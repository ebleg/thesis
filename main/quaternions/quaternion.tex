\chapter{Split-Quaternion Representations of Dynamical Systems}
\label{chap:quaternion}
In this chapter, we propose split-quaternions as an alternative representation of linear two-dimensional dynamical systems instead of traditional state space representation. This is based on the fact that the algebras of split-quaternions and two-dimensional linear matrices are isomorphic. We argue that the split-quaternion representation allows for easier system classification and solution. In addition, we also relate the shape of the solution trajectory of an underdamped system to the associated split-quaternion.

First, we introduce the notion of split-quaternions in \cref{sec:general_quat} and how it can be related to a matrix. Second, in \cref{sec:system_classification}, we relate the split-quaternions to general two-dimensional linear dynamical systems. Finally, in \cref{sec:mechanical}, we use the damped harmonic oscillator to as a representative system and give physical interpretation to the split-quaternion representation and analyze the shape of the solution trajectories. 

The discussion in \cref{sec:general_quat} mainly concerns facts about split-quaternions that have been known in the past. Their application to dynamical systems (i.e. the subject of \cref{sec:system_classification} and \cref{sec:mechanical}) has not been researched in the past; as such, the results presented in these sections are all new.
