\section{The algebra of split-quaternions}
In this section, we present the split-quaternion number system, its basic properties, and its relation with two-dimensional matrices.

\label{sec:general_quat}
\subsection{Basic properties of split-quaternions}
\label{ssec:quat_basics}
Like conventional quaternions, the split-quaternions form a number system that consists of linear combinations of four basis elements, which are denoted by 1, \quati, \quatj, and \quatk.\footnote
{Even though they behave similarly, the imaginary unit \(\ii\) is not to be confused with the split-quaternion basis element \quati, because they each belong to an entirely different number system.}
The algebra of split-quaternions is associative but not commutative --- formally speaking, we are dealing with an algebraic structure called a \emph{noncommutative (unital) ring}. The multiplication table for the split-quaternion algebra is shown in \cref{tab:quat_table}. The set of split-quaternions is denoted by \spquaternions, since \quaternions is reserved for conventional quaternions.\footnote
{The set of (split-)quaternions `\(\mathbb{H}\)' is named in honor of sir William Rowan Hamilton, who also developed the Hamiltonian formalism: the fruits of his work truly form the central theme in this thesis \cite{Stillwell2008}.}
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Multiplication table for the split-quaternion algebra.}
    \label{tab:quat_table}
    \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
        \toprule
        &         1      & \quati  & \quatj  & \quatk \\ 
        \midrule
        1       & 1      & \quati  & \quatj  & \quatk \\ 
        \quati  & \quati & -1      & \quatk  & -\quatj \\ 
        \quatj  & \quatj & -\quatk & 1       & -\quati \\ 
        \quatk  & \quatk & \quatj  & \quati  & 1 \\ 
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The distinctive feature that sets split-quaternions apart from conventional quaternions resides in the diagonal elements of \cref{tab:quat_table}. For quaternions, all basis elements but 1 square to \(-1\), which is not the case for the split-quaternions (only \quati does). This is also the reason why split-quaternions are `split', for this difference in sign makes their norm (to be defined later) into an indefinite quadratic form. That is to say, whereas quaternions have a `metric signature' (in a very imprecise sense of the word metric) of \((+, +, +, +)\), the split-quaternions have \((+, +, -, -)\). The difference `metric' signature makes the split-quaternion number system different from its conventional quaternion counterpart.

Importantly, the split-quaternion algebra can also be seen as an \emph{algebra}; i.e. a four-dimensional vector space over the real numbers combined with the split-quaternion product operation. More specifically, the split-quaternions form a \emph{unital noncommutative associative algebra}.

\subsubsection{The dihedral group} 
On their own, the basis elements of the split-quaternions \(\qty{1, \quati, \quatj, \quatk}\) form a \emph{finite group} under multiplication, namely the \emph{dihedral group} \digroup{4}. This group represents all the symmetries of a square: the identity, a 90-degree rotation, and two reflections, as illustrated in \cref{fig:square_symmetry} \cite{Dummit2004}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/square_symmetry}
    \caption{The dihedral group \digroup{4} is the symmetry group of a square. This group is isomorphic to the group formed by \(1, \quati, \quatj\) and \quatk under multiplication.}
    \label{fig:square_symmetry}
\end{figure}

The structure of the dihedral group can be visualized by means of its \emph{cycle graph} in \cref{fig:cycle_graph}. Many important properties of the split-quaternion algebra and the applications in this chapter can be traced back to the shape of this cycle graph. One example is the `split' nature of the quaternions: the \quati-element generates an order-4 cycle, while \quatj and \quatk generate order-2 cycles. In contrast, the cycle graph for conventional quaternions is entirely symmetric for all these elements \cite{Dummit2004}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/dihedral_group}
    \caption{The cycle graph of the dihedral group $\digroup{4}$. There are five cycles: one of order four which represents the rotations (or the element \quati) of the square, and four order-2 cycles, which are all the possible reflections. The colored element represents the identity.}
    \label{fig:cycle_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Split-quaternion (total) norm} 
Similar to conventional quaternions, we make a distinction between the \emph{scalar} or \emph{real part} and the \emph{vector part} of a split-quaternion. For an arbitrary split-quaternion \(a \in \spquaternions\), \cite{Jafari2014}
\begin{equation}
     a = \quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}
     \label{eq:spquaternion}
\end{equation}
the real part is 
\begin{equation}
    \scapart{a} \coloneq a_0,
\end{equation}
and the vector part is 
\begin{equation} 
    \vecpart{a} \coloneq \quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}.
\end{equation}

Because the vector part and real part are used so often in this chapter, we adopt a more convenient shorthand notation for them, instead of $\scapart{}$ and $\vecpart{}$. Given any split-quaternion, the real part is denoted by the same symbol with a subscript of 0, without having to explicitly define the split-quaternion components as we did in \cref{eq:spquaternion}. In addition, the vector part is denoted by the symbol of the split-quaternion, but set in \textbf{boldface}. For instance, for the split-quaternion $b$, we denote its real part by $b_0 \coloneq \scapart{b}$ and its vector part by $\vec{b} \coloneq \vecpart{b}$. An alternative expression for $b$ is then
\begin{equation}
     b = b_0 + \vec{b}.
\end{equation}

In addition, every split-quaternion has a unique \emph{conjugate} split-quaternion, which has the same real part but the opposite vector part:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
     \conj{a} &\coloneq \scapart{a} - \vecpart{a} \\
              &= a_0 - \vec{a}  \\
              &= a_0 - a_1\quati - a_2\quatj - a_3\quatk.
     \end{split}
\end{equation}

Using the conjugate, we can define the \emph{squared split-quaternion norm}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{N}:\;\spquaternions \to \real:\;\;\mathscr{N}(a) \coloneq a\conj{a} = a_0^2 + a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2. 
    \label{eq:quat_norm}
\end{equation}

The split-quaternion norm is (in stark contrast to the norm defined for quaternions) \emph{indefinite}: it can be positive, negative or zero. Split-quaternions can therefore be categorized into three regimes based on the sign of their squared norm. In the tradition of special relativity, these regimes are named
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a$ is \emph{timelike} if \( \mathscr{N}(a) > 0 \),
    \item $a$ is \emph{lightlike} if \( \mathscr{N}(a) = 0 \), 
    \item $a$ is \emph{spacelike} if \( \mathscr{N}(a) < 0 \).
\end{itemize}
Like the space of split-quaternions, Minkowski spacetime is also four-dimensional. However, the signature of the Minkowski metric is different from the split-quaternion signature: it is either \((-, +, +, +)\) or equivalently \( (+, -, -, -)\) depending on the sign convention one chooses to adhere to. The terminology (i.e. spacelike, timelike, lightlike) applies nonetheless. \cite{Misner1970,Landau1971}

Based on the squared split-quaternion norm, the \emph{split-quaternion norm} is then defined as
\begin{equation}
     \norm{}:\, \spquaternions \to \complex: \;\: \norm{a} \coloneq \sqrt{\mathscr{N}(a)} = \sqrt{a_0^2 + a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2}.
\end{equation}
Because of the indefiniteness of $\mathscr{N}$, $\norm{a}$ is an imaginary number if $a$ is spacelike, for its squared norm is negative in that case.

\subsubsection{Vector norm}
Apart from the split-quaternion norm, we may also define a (squared) norm that only considers the \emph{vector part} of the split-quaternion. The \emph{squared vector norm} is defined in accordance with the total squared split-quaternion norm given by \cref{eq:quat_norm}:
\begin{equation}
     \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = a_1^2 - a^2_2 - a^2_3.
     \label{eq:vector_norm}
\end{equation}
This is not an abuse of notation, for \(\vec{a}\) can be seen as a split-quaternion in its own right with the same vector part as \(a\) but with a zero scalar part. It is therefore a valid argument for the split-quaternion norm, and we can use the same function with no ambiguity. The \emph{vector norm} is then defined in accordance 
\begin{equation}
    \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})} = \sqrt{a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2}. 
\end{equation}

In the remainder of this chapter, the distinction between the squared norm of the entire split-quaternion and its squared vector norm plays a crucial role. Therefore, we will refer to \(\mathscr{N}(a)\) as the squared \emph{total} norm, and to \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})\) as the squared \emph{vector} norm. Likewise, we refer to $\norm{a}$ as the \emph{total} norm, and to $\norm{\vec{a}}$ as the \emph{vector} norm of that split-quaternion.

The quadratic form given in \cref{eq:vector_norm} is also not positive-definite. As a result, we can establish a classification based on the vector norm instead of the total norm as well:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \vec{a} is \emph{timelike} / $a$ has a timelike vector if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) > 0$,
    \item \vec{a} is \emph{lightlike} / $a$ has a lightlike vector if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = 0$,
    \item \vec{a} is \emph{spacelike} / $a$ has a spacelike vector if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0$.
\end{itemize}

Because one can classify based on both the (squared) squared norm and the (squared) total norm, one may identify nine hypothetical cases, since each falls into one of three regimes. However, the squared vector norm is not completely independent from the squared total norm: observe that 
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{N}(a) < 0\quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0,
\end{equation} 
which is to say that \emph{a spacelike split-quaternion always has a spacelike vector part}. The converse is not necessarily true. Furthermore, \emph{a lightlike split-quaternion must have a lightlike or spacelike vector part}, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{N}(a) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) \leq 0
\end{equation}
These two statements rule out three hypothetical combinations for the regimes of the total norm and the vector norm (spacelike - timelike, spacelike - lightlike and lightlike - timelike). Hence, six possible combinations remain; they are listed in \cref{tab:class_combinations}. 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{All the possible combinations of the regime of the split-quaternion and the regime of its vector part. Spacelike split-quaternions can only have a spacelike vector, while lightlike split-quaternions can only have lightlike or spacelike vector parts. The numbering of these cases coincides with the classification of dynamical systems in \cref{ssec:system_classification}.}
    \label{tab:class_combinations}
    \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
        \toprule
        &  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\( \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) \)} \\[1mm]
        \hline
        & & & & \\[-1.7ex]
        &  & \emph{spacelike} & \emph{lightlike} & \emph{timelike} \\
        & \emph{spacelike} & \circled{1} & --- & --- \\
        & \emph{lightlike} & \circled{2} & \circled{3} & --- \\
        \multirow{-3}{*}{\( \mathscr{N}(a) \)} & \emph{timelike} & \circled{4} & \circled{5} & \circled{6} \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
%As such, we can identify a grand total of \emph{nine} categories for split-quaternions, based on each possible combination of quaternion and vector norm `sign' (these can be chosen completely independent from each other). 

The classification given by \cref{tab:class_combinations} is very important because it corresponds directly to the qualitative classification of dynamical systems discussed in \cref{ssec:system_classification}.

In the remainder of this chapter, the split-quaternion properties that are defined above are used profusely. For the convenience of the reader, an overview of these properties and their definitions is provided in \cref{tab:spquat_properties}.

\subsubsection{Lorentzian 3-space}
In contrast to the overall split-quaternion, the vector part of the split-quaternion does live in a space with a Lorentz structure, having three dimensions instead of four. In general, the \emph{Lorentzian $n$-space} is defined as the real vector $\real^n$ space equipped with the \emph{Lorentzian inner product}. 
\begin{equation}
     \lorinner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}} \coloneq a_1b_1 - a_2b_2 - \ldots - a_nb_n, \qquad \vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \real^n.
\end{equation}
Since the Lorentzian inner product has signature $(+, -, \ldots, -)$, the Lorentzian $n$-space is denoted by $\real^{1, n-1}$. For $n = 4$, the Lorentzian space is equal to \emph{Minkowski spacetime}, which forms the mathematical setting of the theory of special relativity. 

Based on the Lorentzian inner product\footnote
{
    Because the Lorentzian inner product fails to be positive definite, it is not strictly an inner product, but rather a \emph{pseudo-inner product}. Likewise, the Lorentzian norm is called a \emph{pseudonorm}.
}, the \emph{Lorentz norm} can be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{\lorinner{\vec{a}}{\vec{a}}},
\end{equation}
For the Lorentzian 3-space $\real^{1, 2}$, the Lorentzian norm coincides with the vector norm for split-quaternions defined in \cref{eq:vector_norm}. Hence, if the vector part of a split-quaternion is regarded as a three-dimensional object in its own right (rather than a split-quaternion with zero real part), it is an element of $\real^{1, 2}$. For this space, we view the split-quaternion basis elements $\quati, \quatj, \quatk$ as \emph{unit basis vectors} to distinguish the vector components.

Next to the Lorentzian inner product, we can also define a \emph{Lorentzian cross product}, which exists only for $\real^{1, 2}$. Given two vectors $\vec{a}, \vec{b}$, in $\real^{1, 2}$
their Lorentzian cross-product is defined as: \cite{Jafari2014}
\begin{gather}
        \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}} \coloneq \det\mqty(-\quati & \quatj & \quatk \\ a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3) \qquad \vec{a}, \vec{b} \\
            = \qty(a_3b_2 - a_2b_3)\quati + \qty(a_3b_1 - a_1b_3)\quatj + \qty(a_1b_2 - a_3b_1)\quatk,
\end{gather}
where we have assumed $\quati, \quatj, \quatk$ as basis vectors.

The split-quaternion product can be conveniently expressed in terms of the Lorentzian inner product and cross product. For two split-quaternions $a$ and $b$ with their respective vector parts $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, we have the following relation:
\begin{equation}
    ab = a_0 b_0 - \lorinner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}} + a_0 \vec{b} + b_0 \vec{a} + \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Relation with two-dimensional matrix algebra}
\label{ssec:quat_isomorphism}
In this section, we demonstrate how the split-quaternion algebra relates to the algebra of real $2\times2$-matrices.

\subsubsection{Algebra isomorphisms} 
Formally, an algebra is a vector space combined \(V\) over a field \field, combined with an \field-bilinear product operation \cite{Schuller2014}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The split-quaternion algebra is an algebra over the field real numbers (\(\field = \real\)), where the multiplication is the split-quaternion multiplication (see \cref{tab:quat_table});
    \item The \(2\times2\)-matrices also form an \real-vector space; the product operation is matrix multiplication.
\end{itemize}

An \emph{algebra isomorphism} is an isomorphism between vector spaces that also commutes with the respective product operations in both vector spaces. If \((V, \bullet)\) and \((W, \diamond)\) are vector spaces equipped with their respective product operations $\bullet$ and $\diamond$, then \(\phi: V \to W\) is an algebra isomorphism if \cite{Lang2002}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \(\phi\) is a vector space isomorphism between \(V\) and \(W\), and 
    \item the isomorphism commutes with the product operation, i.e. 
    \begin{equation}
         \phi(v_1 \bullet v_2) = \phi(v_1)\diamond\phi(v_2) \qquad v_1, v_2 \in V.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

In the case of the split-quaternions and two-dimensional matrices, it is sufficient to map the basis elements of the split-quaternions to four linearly independent `basis' matrices, and show that the resulting matrices observe the same multiplication rules as defined in \cref{tab:quat_table}. Indeed, define the mapping \(\phi\) by 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \phi: \: \spquaternions \to \real^{2\times2}: \quad &  
         1 \mapsto  \mqty(1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1) \qquad
        \quati \mapsto  \mqty(0 & 1 \\  -1 & 0) \\
        & \quatj \mapsto  \mqty(0 & 1 \\  1 & 0)\qquad 
        \quatk \mapsto  \mqty(1 & 0 \\  0 & -1) \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:basis_elements}
\end{equation}

It is easily verified that (i) these matrices span \(\real^{2\times2}\) and (ii) that the multiplication rules for split-quaternions are in accordance when mapped to the respective matrices under matrix multiplication. Due to the bilinearity of the product, any linear combination of the basis elements will therefore satisfy the rules as well. Hence, we have established an algebra isomorphism between the split-quaternions and the \(2\times 2\)-matrices. 

Based on the mapping \(\phi\) for the basis vectors, a general quaternion $a$ maps to:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(\quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}) \quad = \quad \mqty(a_0 + a_3 & a_1 + a_2 \\ a_2 - a_1 & a_0 - a_3). 
    \label{eq:quat_isom}
\end{equation}
Likewise, the inverse mapping of an arbitrary matrix yields
\begin{equation}
    \phi^{-1}\mqty(b_0 & b_1 \\ b_2 & b_3) \quad = \quad \quat{\frac{b_0 + b_3}{2}}{\qty(\frac{b_1 - b_2}{2})}{\qty(\frac{b_1 + b_2}{2})}{\qty(\frac{b_0 - b_3}{2})}. 
    \label{eq:inv_quat_isom}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Relation between matrix and split-quaternion properties} 
A striking feature of the isomorphism \(\phi\) is that it maps the natural properties of the split-quaternion to the natural properties of the associated matrix. Given that \(A = \phi(a)\) with \(a \in \spquaternions\) and \(A \in \real^{2\times2}\), we have the following correspondence: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{sum of matrices} is equivalent to the \emph{sum of the split-quaternions}. If \(A = \phi(a)\) and \(B = \phi(b)\), then
        \begin{equation}
            A + B = \phi(a + b).
        \end{equation}
    \item \emph{Matrix multiplication} is equivalent to \emph{split-quaternion multiplication}. If \(A = \phi(a)\) and \(B = \phi(b)\), then
        \begin{equation}
              AB = \phi(ab).
        \end{equation}
    \item The \emph{adjugate} of the matrix maps to the \emph{conjugate} of the split-quaternion:\footnote
        {The adjugate of a matrix is the transpose of its cofactor matrix \cite{Verhaegen2007}.}
        \begin{equation}
             \adjugate(A) = \phi(\conj{a}).
        \end{equation}
    \item The \emph{trace} of the matrix coincides with twice the \emph{real or scalar part} of the split-quaternion:
        \begin{equation}
             \frac{\trace(A)}{2} = \scapart{a} = a_0.
        \end{equation}
    \item The \emph{determinant} of the matrix is equal to the \emph{squared total norm} of the split-quaternion:
        \begin{equation}
              \det(A) = \mathscr{N}(a).
        \end{equation}
    \item The equivalence of the determinant and the split-quaternion norm suggests that the \emph{multiplicative inverse} of a split-quaternion does not always exist: it must be nonzero. In that case, it is clear that
        \begin{equation}
             \phi\qty(a^{-1}) = A^{-1} \qquad \mathscr{N}(a) \neq 0.
        \end{equation}
    The determinant property also shows us what the regime of the product of two split-quaternions is; this is shown in \cref{tab:multiplication_class}.
        \begin{table}[h!]
        \centering
        \caption{Regime transition under the action of split-quaternion multiplication. The timelike split-quaternions form a group under multiplication, the timelike and spacelike split-quaternions do not: timelike split-quaternions do not have an inverse and the spacelike split-quaternions are not closed.}
        \label{tab:multiplication_class}
        \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
            \toprule
            \(\times\) & \emph{space} & \emph{light} & \emph{time} \\[1mm]
            \hline
            \emph{space} & time  & light & space \\
            \emph{light} & light & light & light \\
            \emph{time} &  space & light & time \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
    \item Importantly, the \emph{eigenvalues} of a $2\times2$-matrix $A$ can be expressed in terms of its trace and its determinant:
        \begin{equation}
             \lambda_A = \frac{\trace(A) \pm \sqrt{\trace^2(A) - 4\det(A)}}{2}.
        \end{equation}
        The argument of the square root in the above expression is equal to the \emph{negative of the squared vector norm} of \(a\). We therefore have:
        \begin{equation}
            \lambda_A = \frac{2a_0 \pm \sqrt{4 a_0^2 - 4\mathscr{N}(a)}}{2} = 
                a_0 \pm \ii\norm{\vec{a}},
            \label{eq:quat_eigvals}
        \end{equation}
        where $\norm{\vec{a}}$ is imaginary if $\vec{a}$ is spacelike. 
        Hence, the \emph{real part and the vector norm the split-quaternion coincide with the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix}, where the latter is multiplied by the imaginary unit $\ii$. When the vector either is spacelike or timelike, the $\ii$ cancels, and the overall eigenvalue is real. This striking correspondence is the main reason for the benefits of the split-quaternion representation of dynamical systems, which is discussed in \cref{ssec:system_classification}.

\paragraph{Split-quaternions as a Lie algebra} 
The algebra of \(2\times 2\)-matrices, and therefore of split-quaternions, is a Lie algebra.

%The algebra of \(2\times2\)-matrices (or equivalently, of the split-quaternions) also constitute the Lie algebra \(\glalg{2}{\real}\) of the two-dimensional general linear group \(\glgroup{2}{\real}\). Furthermore, the traceless matrices, or equivalently, the split-quaternions with zero real part form the subalgebra \(\slalg{2}{\real}\) of the special linear group \(\slgroup{2}{\real}\). These are the volume-preserving automorphisms on \(\real^2\). Because in \(\real^2\), volume and area coincide, the special linear group and the symplectic group \(\spgroup{1}\) are equivalents. For higher dimensions, this is not the case: area preservation is generally a stronger condition than volume preservation. The Lie algebra elements of the symplectic group are called Hamiltonian matrices; therefore, split-quaternions with no real part are referred to as \emph{Hamiltonian}.

\section{Dynamical systems as split-quaternions}
\label{sec:system_classification}
In this section, we show how split-quaternions can be used to represent two-dimensional linear dynamical systems in their full generality. We commence in \cref{ssec:vf_algebra} by relating a basis vector field to each of the split-quaternion basis elements. Subsequently, in \cref{ssec:system_classification} we show how the relation between the eigenvalues of a matrix and the (vector) norm of the split-quaternion leads to an easy classification procedure. Finally, we use those same properties, to obtain the system solution (through the exponential) as well in \cref{ssec:system_solution}.

\subsection{The algebra of vector fields}
\label{ssec:vf_algebra}
The isomorphism between the split-quaternions and the algebra of two-dimensional square matrices exposed in the preceding section can be used to develop an alternative representation of linear dynamical systems. Indeed, an autonomous dynamical system is defined by a \emph{vector field} on the state space. If this vector field is a linear mapping from the state space into the tangent space, it can be represented by a matrix. 

\subsubsection{Basis vector fields} The vector fields corresponding to two-dimensional linear dynamical systems form a vector space on their own, spanned (for example) by the four basis elements shown in \cref{eq:basis_elements}. Each of the basis elements \(1,\,\quati,\,\quatj,\,\quatk\) corresponds to a specific `basis' vector field, denoted by \(X_1\), \(X_{\quati}\), \(X_{\quatj}\) and \(X_{\quatk}\) respectively. The basis vector fields are shown in \cref{fig:basis_vf}. 

The basis vector field \(X_1\), corresponding to the identity element is an infinitesimal dilation, while \(X_{\quati}\) represents an infinitesimal clockwise rotation, and \(X_{\quatj}\) and \(X_{\quatj}\) are infinitesimal `squeeze mappings', hyperbolic rotations or \emph{Lorentz transformations} along two different sets of principal axes. The binary operation of matrix multiplication translates to the composition of the vector fields.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/basis_vectorfields}
    \caption{Basis vector fields corresponding to the basis elements of the split-quaternions.}
    \label{fig:basis_vf}
\end{figure}

Apart from the multiplication operation for split-quaternions and matrices, we can also define the \emph{commutator} of a binary operation, which measures exactly by how much two elements fail to commute. For split-quaternions, matrices, and vector fields the commutator is defined as (in that order): 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \liebr{a}{b} &= ab - ba,\quad a, b \in \spquaternions, \\
        \liebr{A}{B} &= AB - BA,\quad A, B \in \real^{2\times 2}, \\
        \liebr{X}{Y} &= \lied{X}{Y},\quad X,Y\in \vfields{M},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
for some smooth manifold \(M\) of the appropriate dimension. For vector fields, the commutator is also referred to as the \emph{Lie bracket} (it therefore defines the \emph{Lie algebra} \(\slalg{2}{\real}\)). The commutation relations (or \emph{structure constants}) for the basis vector fields are \cite{Schuller2014}
\begin{gather}
    \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quati}} = \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quatj}} = \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quatk}} = 0, \\
    \liebr{X_{\quati}}{X_{\quatj}} = 2X_{\quatk}, \qquad  
    \liebr{X_{\quati}}{X_{\quatk}} = -2X_{\quatj}, \qquad
    \liebr{X_{\quatj}}{X_{\quatk}} = -2X_{\quati}.
\end{gather}
Of course, these commutation relations are exactly the same for the corresponding split-quaternion or matrix basis elements. Scalar multiples of the identity element commute with every other element of the algebra; they are in the \emph{center} of the algebra. Importantly, the vector field \(X_1\) and all its multiples commute with 
\emph{all} the other vector fields. This has important ramifications: it means that one can consider the action associated with those vector fields as completely separate from the action of the other vector field components, for they do not influence each other in the process. This fact will be used in \cref{sec:mechanical}.

\subsection{Classification of dynamical systems}
\label{ssec:system_classification}
The classification of two-dimensional linear dynamical systems is important, for they also locally represent the fixed points of general nonlinear systems. Traditionally, this decomposition is done according to the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix \(A\), or equivalently, through a Poincaré diagram as shown in \cref{fig:poincare_diagram}. Because the split-quaternion norms are directly related to the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix, we propose that the split-quaternion representation offers a more convenient alternative, based on their squared (vector) norm, on par with the regimes defined in \cref{tab:class_combinations}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/poincare_diagram}
    \caption{The classic Poincaré diagram, is based on the conventional classification of fixed points based on the trace and determinant of the state transition matrix \(A\). The corresponding split-quaternion regimes defined in \cref{tab:class_combinations} are displayed as well. The determinant axis coincides with the squared norm of the split quaternion being 0, while all the points on the parabolic line correspond to split-quaternions with zero \emph{vector} norm. A further distinction is made with the scalar part of the split-quaternion, which, for each of the regimes, determines (asymptotic) (in)stability.}
    \label{fig:poincare_diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Spacelike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{1}] For spacelike split-quaternions, there is only one possibility: a negative split-quaternion norm corresponds to a negative determinant, which means that the fixed point is a \emph{saddle}. We can distinguish one particular case: if the scalar part of the split-quaternion is zero (\(a_0 = 0\)), the saddle is `balanced' and generates a proper \emph{squeeze mapping}, which is a symplectomorphism of the phase space. The split-quaternion is therefore Hamiltonian. An example of the latter is the linearization of the unstable fixed point of a rotational pendulum.
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Lightlike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{2}] \emph{Spacelike vector norm}: in this case, there is not just a fixed point but a fixed line in the phase space. This fixed line is stable or unstable depending on the sign of the scalar part of the quaternion. 
        \item[\circled{3}] \emph{Lightlike vector norm}: this case is degenerate to the second degree; it coincides with the origin in the Poincaré diagram. The associated vector field is purely translational. An example is an object in uniform motion.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Timelike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{4}] \emph{Spacelike vector norm}: this case gives rise to eigenvalues that are purely real; the fixed point is called a \emph{node}. Depending on the sign of the scalar part, the fixed point can be an unstable node or \emph{source} (\(a_0 > 0\)) or a stable node or \emph{sink} (\(a_0 < 0\)). An example of such a system is the overdamped harmonic oscillator.
        \item[\circled{5}] \emph{Lightlike vector norm}: In this case, the two eigenvalues are equal to each other. This can be seen from the expression of the vector norm in terms of the matrix properties: 
            \begin{equation}
                 \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = \mathscr{N}(a - a_0) = \det(A - \frac{\trace(A)}{2}I).
            \end{equation}
        When the two eigenvalues are identical, \(\trace(A) = 2\lambda\), the above expression necessarily vanishes and the split-quaternion, therefore, has a lightlike vector part. There are then two subcategories to be distinguished, depending on whether the matrix is diagonalizable or not:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If the matrix is diagonalizable, it \emph{must} be a scalar multiple of the identity \cite{Edwards2018}. This is because the rank of the matrix \( A - \lambda I\) must be equal to 0 for the eigenspace to be two-dimensional. The corresponding split-quaternion is then \emph{purely real}; i.e. \(a = \lambda\). Because it has no vector part, the vector is then lightlike in the most trivial fashion. The associated fixed point is then a \emph{star}, which can either be stable or unstable depending on the sign of the real part (this particular case is not shown in \cref{fig:poincare_diagram}). 
            \item Conversely, if the vector norm is zero but the vector part is not, the matrix is not diagonalizable for the reason mentioned above: the null space of \( A - \lambda I\) is one-dimensional, and can therefore not be spanned by two independent eigenvectors. The fixed point is an \emph{improper node}, which is again stable or unstable depending on the sign of the real part.
            %the eigenvalues of the associated matrix are real and equal; this type of fixed point is named a \emph{degenerate node}. More specifically, in the unstable case (\(a_0 > 0\)) it is called a \emph{degenerate source}, while in the stable case it is referred to as a \emph{degenerate sink}. An example is a critically damped harmonic oscillator. 
        \end{itemize}
        An example of this type of system is the critically damped harmonic oscillator.
        \item[\circled{6}] \emph{Timelike vector norm}: this really is the only general case where the eigenvalues of \(A\) are complex. If \(a_0 = 0\), the eigenvalues are imaginary and the fixed point is a \emph{center}. Again, for \(a_0 > 0\) it is an \emph{unstable spiral node} and for \(a_0 < 0\) a \emph{stable spiral node}. An example is an underdamped (or even undamped) harmonic oscillator.
    \end{itemize}

It is clear from the present discussion that the split-quaternions offer a very natural representation of linear dynamical systems, and their natural properties translate directly to the classification of the qualitative behavior of these systems.

\subsection{The exponential function of split-quaternions}
\label{ssec:exponential}
Just like the concept of the exponential function was originally generalized for square matrices, we can do the same for split-quaternions in an analogous manner. As such, the \emph{split-quaternion exponential function} is defined as
\begin{equation}
     \exp(a) \equiv \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a^k}{k!} \qquad a \in \spquaternions.
\end{equation}
Because this definition is identical to the one for matrices, we may, as a result of the isomorphism defined in \cref{ssec:quat_isomorphism}, also expect the exact same result; i.e.
\begin{equation}
     \exp(a) = \phi^{-1}(\exp(\phi(a)))
\end{equation}
where the second exponential function refers to the matrix exponential instead.

To evaluate the exponential function of a split-quaternion, let us first use the following property of the matrix exponential \cite{Hall2013}
\begin{equation}
     AB = BA \quad \Rightarrow \quad \exp(A + B),
\end{equation}
i.e. we can only `split' the exponential of a sum if the two elements \emph{commute}. We can regard an arbitrary split-quaternion
\begin{equation}
     a = \quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}
\end{equation}
as the sum of \(a_0\) and \(\quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}\). The real part is distinguished from the other three parts in the sense that it commutes
with every other element (cf. \cref{ssec:vf_algebra}). We may therefore use the former property and apply it to the split-quaternion exponential as well:
\begin{equation}
     \exp(a) \, = \,\ec^{a_0}\,\exp(\quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}).
\end{equation}
We therefore only have to be considered with the evaluation exponential of \(\vec{a}\). To do so, observe that we can consider the vector part of a split-quaternion to be a split-quaternion in its own right, but with zero real part. This means that \( \conj{\vec{a}} = -\vec{a} \), and the squared vector norm is simply the negative of the square of the vector part:
\begin{equation}
     \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = \vec{a} \conj{\vec{a}} = -\vec{a}^2.
\end{equation}
Let us now introduce the concept of \emph{unit split-quaternion vectors}, which are vector split-quaternions with a vector norm of \(\pm 1\). The unit vector may be obtained by normalization of the vector part:
\begin{equation}
     \hat{\vec{a}} = \frac{\vec{a}}{\sqrt{\abs{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}}} \qquad \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) \neq 0,
\end{equation}
which squares to
\begin{equation}
     \hat{\vec{a}}^2 = - \mathscr{N}(\hat{\vec{a}}) 
                   = - \frac{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}{\abs{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}} 
                   = - \sgn(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})).
\end{equation}
Normalizing lightlike vectors is not possible, because they have all the same length of zero: there is no point in making the distinction between vector and unit vector. Based on the regime of the vector part, three possibilities arise: \cite{Motter1998,Harkin2004}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is timelike, then \(\uvec{a}^2 = -1\). We can therefore say that the unit vector `behaves' like the imaginary unit \(\ii\) (\(\ii^2 = -1\)). In general, we can identify the split-quaternion (with timelike vector part) \( a_0 + \norm{a}\uvec{a}\) with the \emph{complex number} \(a_0 + \norm{\vec{a}}\ii\). 
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is lightlike, then \(\vec{a}^2 = 0\), and the notion of the unit vector is not well-defined. Because the vector is nilpotent with degree 2, it is analogous to the nilpotent unit \(\epsilon\) (for which we have that \(\epsilon^2 = 0\)). Split-quaternions with timelike vector part can be identified with the \emph{dual number} \(a_0 + \epsilon\). 
    \item Finally, if \(\vec{a}\) is spacelike, then \(\uvec{a}^2 = 1\). The unit vector behaves like the idempotent unit \(\jj\), with defining property \(\jj^2 = 1\) (\(\jj \notin \real\)!).\footnote
        {Again, we must take care not to confuse the hyperbolic unit with the split-quaternion basis element \(\quatj\). They behave the same and are related in the sense that they give rise to `split' behavior, but are part of a very different number systems.}
        Likewise, a split-quaternion with spacelike vector part is analogous to the \emph{split-complex number} (or hyperbolic number) \(a_0 + \norm{\vec{a}}\jj\).
\end{itemize}

The connection between split-quaternions and the generalized complex numbers\footnote
{For a more detailed account of generalized complex numbers, the reader is referred to \citet{Harkin2004}.}
(i.e. complex, dual and split-complex)
sheds some additional light on the behavior of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix \(A\) by means of the root locus plot (see \cref{eq:quat_eigvals}). A typical branch of the  root locus consists of a complex pole pair approaching the real axis when the gain is increased. When they finally collide on the real axis, they each go their opposite ways on the real axis, essentially breaking the symmetry with respect to the real axis. The split-quaternions and hypercomplex numbers paint a slightly more elegant picture, which is shown in \cref{fig:root_locus}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As shown above, when the pole pair is complex, the associated split-quaternion vector is timelike. The eigenvalues are naturally conjugate with respect to the real axis, i.e.
        \begin{equation}
             \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}}\ii.
        \end{equation}
    \item When the pole pair collides on the real axis (often called the \emph{branch point}), the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is zero, and the vector is timelike. Observe that we can make the case that, because the branches continue afterward in a separate manner, they cannot be \emph{exactly} the same. Indeed, the eigenvalues are
        \begin{equation}
             \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \epsilon.
        \end{equation}
        The nilpotent unit \(\epsilon\) is often interpreted as a differential, or an infinitesimally small quantity.\footnote{A common application of dual numbers is automatic differentiation: because higher powers vanish, they can be used to generate first-order polynomial approximations. The unit `circle' for dual numbers consists of two vertical lines crossing the horizontal axis at \(\pm 1\). These lines can again be interpreted as linear approximations of the actual unit circle (or unit hyperbola) associated with (split-)complex numbers. The plane is spanned by the \(\jj\)-axis and the real axis is the split-complex plane. The `projection' to the real axis is in this plane a reflection with respect to the light cone (first diagonal).} We argue that in this case, the pole pair is still conjugate, but the poles differ only by an infinitesimal amount.
    \item When the gain is increased further, the poles are real and the symmetry with respect to the real axis is broken. However, we can infer from the preceding discussion that the imaginary part is now hyperbolic instead, i.e.
        \begin{equation}
             \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}}\jj.
        \end{equation}
        Of course, it is possible to project these points on the real axis, but this obscures the natural symmetry of the root locus branch. In \cref{fig:root_locus}, we, therefore, put the hyperbolic part on a third axis.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/root_locus}
    \caption{A generalized version of a root locus plot in terms of hypercomplex numbers. The traditional root locus is set in the complex \(s\)-plane (shown in blue), but we added a third axis for the hyperbolic part of the eigenvalue. When the gain is increased, the initially complex pole pair ventures towards the real axis. If the pole pair is critically damped, both poles are separated from the real axis by an infinitesimal distance of \(\epsilon\). Increasing the gain, even more, pushes the pole pair into the hyperbolic regime (the associated split-quaternion vector is now spacelike). Observe that in this picture, the symmetry with respect to the real axis is preserved. In the traditional root locus, these points are projected onto the real axis, indicated by the dashed lines. }
    \label{fig:root_locus}
\end{figure}

Let us now return to the exponential function. We can manipulate the definition of \(\exp(a)\) as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\;\qty(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\vec{a}^k}{k!} ) \\
                &= \ec^{a_0}\;\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\qty(\vec{a}^2)^k}{(2k)!}  + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\vec{a}\qty(\vec{a}^2)^k}{(2k+1)!}]. \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, if \(\vec{a}\) is not lightlike, we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \exp(a) = \ec^{a_0}\;\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}\, \qty(\uvec{a}^2)^k}{(2k)!}  + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1} \, \qty(\uvec{a}^2)^k}{(2k+1)!}].
\end{equation*}
Once again, there are three possibilities, depending on the regime of \(\vec{a}\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{timelike}, then the above expression reverts to
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}\,\qty(-1)^k}{(2k)!} + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1} \, \qty(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty\big[\cos(\norm{a})  + \uvec{a}\sin(\norm{a})]. \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        This is roughly equivalent to the Euler identity for complex numbers, which is not at all surprising since we found before that \(\uvec{a}\) can be associated with the imaginary unit if \(\vec{a}\) is timelike.
    \item Secondly, if \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{lightlike}, we can simply use the definition of the exponential in its original form: \footnote{We can also use the `split' expression, defining that \(0^0 \equiv 1\), a common convention in power series and algebra. Observe that the trigonometric functions associated with the dual numbers (i.e. the lightlike vectors) are then equal to the small-angle approximation for \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) \cite{Graham1994, Harkin2004}.}
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\,\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \frac{\vec{a}^k}{k!}, \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[1 + \vec{a} + \sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{\vec{a}^{k-2}\vec{a}^2}{k!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty(1 + \vec{a}). \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
    \item Finally, if \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{spacelike}, we have
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}}{(2k)!} 
                           + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty\big[\cosh(\norm{a}) + \uvec{a}\sinh(\norm{a})]. \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
The exponential map of a split-quaternion can be used to obtain the solution of the corresponding linear differential equation. For the linear ordinary differential equation
\begin{equation}
     \dv{\vec{x}}{t} = A\vec{x}
\end{equation}
has the following solution \cite{Arnold1984}
\begin{equation}
     \vec{x}(t) = \exp(At)\vec{x}_0,
\end{equation}
where the one-parameter group of transformations generated by \(\exp(A t)\) is referred to as the \emph{flow} of the vector field \(A\vec{x}\). Hence, for two-dimensional systems, the matrix \(A\) can be represented by a split-quaternion, and we have just derived easy and insightful ways to evaluate its exponential: 
\begin{equation}
    \exp(a t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty[\cos(\norm{\vec{a}} t) + \uvec{a}\sin(\norm{\vec{a}} t)] & \vec{a} \text{ timelike}, \\[1.5ex]
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty(1 + \norm{\vec{a}}t ) & \vec{a} \text{ lightlike}, \\[1.5ex]
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty[\cosh(\norm{\vec{a}} t) + \uvec{a}\sinh(\norm{\vec{a}} t)] & \vec{a} \text{ spacelike}. \\[1.5ex]
    \end{cases}
    \label{ssec:system_solution}
\end{equation}
Evaluating a matrix exponential by hand usually involves diagonalizing (strictly speaking, finding the Jordan form). The convenience of using split-quaternions instead resides in the fact that they resolve the ambiguity that is naturally present in the eigenvectors of the matrix \(A\); especially when they are complex. In the next section, the relation between the eigenvectors and the unit vector \(\uvec{a}\) are discussed in greater detail \cite{Moler2003}.
