\section{Split-quaternion algebra}
\subsection{Basic properties}
\label{ssec:quat_basics}
Like conventional quaternions, the split-quaternions form a number system that consists of linear combinations of four basis elements, which will be denoted by 1, \quati, \quatj and \quatk.\footnote
{Even though they behave similarly, the imaginary unit $\ii$ is not to be confused with the split-quaternion basis element \quati, because they belong to different number systems.}
The algebra of split-quaternions is associative but not commutative --- formally speaking, we are dealing with an algebraic structure called a \emph{noncommutative ring}. The multiplication table for the split-quaternion algebra is shown in \cref{tab:quat_table}. The set of split-quaternions is denoted by \spquaternions, since \quaternions is reserved for conventional quaternions.\footnote
{The `$\mathbb{H}$' is in honour of sir William Rowan Hamilton, who also developed the Hamiltonian formalism: the fruits of his work truly form the central theme in this thesis. \cite{Stillwell2008}}
\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \caption{Multiplication table for the split-quaternion algebra.}
    \label{tab:quat_table}
    \begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
        \toprule
        &         1      & \quati  & \quatj  & \quatk \\ 
        \midrule
        1       & 1      & \quati  & \quatj  & \quatk \\ 
        \quati  & \quati & -1      & \quatk  & -\quatj \\ 
        \quatj  & \quatj & -\quatk & 1       & -\quati \\ 
        \quatk  & \quatk & \quatj  & \quati  & 1 \\ 
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The distinctive feature that sets split-quaternions apart from conventional quaternions resides in the diagonal elements of \cref{tab:quat_table}. For quaternions, all the nonreal basis elements square to $-1$, which is not the case for the split-quaternions (only \quati does). This is also the reason why split-quaternions are `split', for this difference in sign makes their norm (to be defined later) into an indefinite quadratic form. That is to say, whereas quaternions have a `metric signature' (in a very imprecise sense of the word metric) of $(+, +, +, +)$, for the split-quaternions we have $(+, +, -, -)$. The difference `metric' signature makes the algebra of split-quaternions different from its conventional quaternion counterpart.

\paragraph{Dihedral group} The basis elements of the split-quaternions $\qty{1, \quati, \quatj, \quatk}$ form a finite group under multiplication, namely the \emph{dihedral group} \digroup{4}, which represents all the symmetries of a square: the identity, a 90-degree rotation and two reflections, as illustrated in \cref{fig:square_symmetry}. \cite{Dummit2004}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/square_symmetry}
    \caption{The dihedral group \digroup{4} is the symmetry group of a square. This group is isomorphic to the group formed by $1, \quati, \quatj$ and \quatk under multiplication.}
    \label{fig:square_symmetry}
\end{figure}

The structure of the dihedral group can be visualized by its \emph{cycle graph} in \cref{fig:cycle_graph}. Many important properties of the split-quaternion algebra and the applications in this chapter can be traced back to the shape of this cycle graph. One example is the split nature of the quaternions: the \quati-element generates an order-4 cycle, while \quatj and \quatk generate order-2 cycles (in contrast, the cycle graph for conventional quaternions is entirely symmetric for all these elements). \cite{Dummit2004}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/dihedral_group}
    \caption{Cycle graph of the dihedral group. There are five cycles: one of order four which represents the rotations (or the element \quati), and four order-2 cycles, which are all the possible reflections. The colored element represents the identity.}
    \label{fig:cycle_graph}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Split-quaternion norm} Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part. Likewise, (split)-quaternions have a similar notion: a \emph{scalar} (or real) and \emph{vector} (or imaginary) components. For an arbitrary split-quaternion $a \in \spquaternions$, \cite{Jafari2014}
$$ a = \quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3} $$
the real part is $\scapart{a} = a_0$ and the vector part is $ \vecpart{a} = \quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}$. For convenience, the vector part will be referred to in traditional bold vector notation:
$$ \vec{a} \equiv \vecpart{a} \equiv \quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}. $$

Furthermore, for every split-quaternion there is a unique \emph{conjugate}
$$ \conj{a} = \scapart{a} - \vecpart{a} = a_0 - a_1\quati - a_2\quatj - a_3\quatk, $$
which we require to define the \emph{squared split-quaternion norm}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{N}:\;\spquaternions \to \real:\;\;\mathscr{N}(a) \equiv a\conj{a} = a_0^2 + a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2. 
    \label{eq:quat_norm}
\end{equation}
As mentioned, this norm is not positive definite, in stark contrast to quaternions (or complex numbers, for that matter). 

Split-quaternions can be categorized into three regimes based on their norm being negative, zero or positive. In the tradition of special relativity, these regimes are named\footnote
{Spacetime is also four-dimensional, but the signature of the Minkowski metric is different from the split-quaternion signature: it is either $(-, +, +, +)$ or equivalently $ (+, -, -, -)$ depending on the sign convention one chooses to observe. The terminology (i.e. spacelike, timelike, lightlike) applies nonetheless.} \cite{Misner1970,Landau1971}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{timelike} if $ \mathscr{N}(a) > 0 $,
    \item \emph{lightlike} if $ \mathscr{N}(a) = 0 $, 
    \item \emph{spacelike} if $ \mathscr{N}(a) < 0 $.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{split-quaternion norm} is then defined as
$$ \norm{a} \equiv \sqrt{\abs{\mathscr{N}(a)}}. $$

\paragraph{Vector norm}
Apart from the split-quaternion norm, we may also define a (square) norm that only considers the \emph{vector part} of the split-quaternion. This squared norm is defined in accordance with the overall squared split-quaternion norm given by \cref{eq:quat_norm}:
$$ \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = a_1^2 - a^2_2 - a^2_3. $$
The notation used here is not abusive: $\vec{a}$ simply refers to the split-quaternion with the same vector part as $a$ but with zero scalar part. We can therefore use the same function with no ambiguity. Likewise, the vector norm is $ \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{\abs{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}} $. 

The quadratic form of the squared vector norm is not positive-definite either; in the the same vein as before, we can therefore classify split-quaternions by the `sign' of their vector part again. We refer to (vectors in) these regimes as \emph{timelike (vectors)}, \emph{spacelike (vectors)} and \emph{lightlike (vectors)} in the same fashion. 

In contrast to the larger space of split-quaternions, the space of vectors \emph{does} have a traditional Lorentz (i.e. `special relativity') structure, but in three dimensions instead of four. This is because the signature of the squared vector norm only has one minus sign instead of two. The above expression is equivalent the Lorentz norm applied to a vector in $\real^3$; we will denote $\real^3$ equipped with the Lorentz norm by $\real^{1, 2}$, and call it the Lorentzian three-space. \cite{Jafari2014} 

Observe that $ \mathscr{N}(a) < 0 \Rightarrow \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0$; that is to say, \emph{a spacelike split-quaternion always has a spacelike vector part}. The converse is not necessarily true. Along the same line, a lightlike split-quaternion can only have a lightlike or spacelike vector part. All possible regime combinations for split-quaternions and their vector parts are listed in \cref{tab:class_combinations}. This classification is important because, as discussed in \cref{sec:system_classification}, this classification is precisely equivalent to the qualitative classification of dynamical systems. It will play a central role throughout this chapter.

    \centering
    \caption{All the possible combinations of the regime of a split-quaternion and its vector part. Spacelike split-quaternions can only have a spacelike vector, while lightlike split-quaternions can only have lightlike or spacelike vector parts.}

\end{table}
%As such, we can identify a grand total of \emph{nine} categories for split-quaternions, based on each possible combination of quaternion and vector norm `sign' (these can be chosen completely independent from each other). 

In the remainder of this chapter, the split-quaternion properties that are defined above are used profusely. \Cref{tab:spquat_properties} provides an overview of these properties and their definition.

\subsection{Relation with two-dimensional matrix algebra}
\label{ssec:quat_isomorphism}
The utility of split-quaternions (for our purpose) originates from the fact that the algebra of split-quaternions is isomorphic to the algebra of real two-dimensional matrices. This underlies this entire chapter, for it allows us to find an alternative for the traditional matrix description of linear dynamical systems. 

\paragraph{Algebra isomorphisms} Formally, an algebra is a vector space combined with a vector space $V$ over a field \field, combined with an addition operation, scalar multiplication, and an \field-bilinear product operation $V\times V \to V$. \cite{Schuller2014}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The split-quaternion algebra is an algebra over the field real numbers ($\field = \real$), where the multiplication is governed by the split-quaternion multiplication rules (see \cref{tab:quat_table}).
    \item The set of $2\times2$-matrices also constitutes an \real-vector space; matrix multiplication makes it into an algebra.
\end{itemize}

An algebra isomorphism is an isomorphism between vector spaces that also commutes with the respective product operations in both vector spaces. If $(V, \bullet)$ and $(W, \diamond)$ are vector spaces equipped with their product operations, then $\phi: V \to W$ is an algebra isomorphism if (i) $\phi$ is a vector space isomorphism between $V$ and $W$, and (ii) \cite{Lang2002}
$$ \phi(v_1 \bullet v_2) = \phi(v_1)\diamond\phi(v_2) \qquad v_1, v_2 \in V. $$

In the case of the split-quaternions and two-dimensional matrices, it is sufficient to map the basis elements of the split-quaternions to four linearly independent `basis' matrices, and show that the resulting matrices observe the same multiplication rules as defined in \cref{tab:quat_table}. Indeed, define the mapping $\phi$ by 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \phi: \spquaternions \to \real^{2\times2}: \quad &  
         1 \mapsto  \mqty(1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1) \qquad
        \quati \mapsto  \mqty(0 & 1 \\  -1 & 0) \\
        & \quatj \mapsto  \mqty(0 & 1 \\  1 & 0)\qquad 
        \quatk \mapsto  \mqty(1 & 0 \\  0 & -1) \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:basis_elements}
\end{equation}

It is easily verified that (i) these matrices span $\real^{2\times2}$ and (ii) that the multiplication rules for split-quaternions are in accordance when translated to the respective matrices under matrix multiplication. Due to the bilinearity of the product, any linear combination of the basis elements will therefore satisfy the rules as well. Hence, we have established an algebra isomorphism between the split-quaternions and the $2\times 2$-matrices. 

Based on the mapping $\phi$ for the basis vectors, a general quaternion is sent to 
\begin{equation}
    \phi(\quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}) \quad = \quad \mqty(a_0 + a_3 & a_1 + a_2 \\ a_2 - a_1 & a_0 - a_3). 
    \label{eq:quat_isom}
\end{equation}
Likewise, the inverse mapping on an arbitrary matrix yields
\begin{equation}
    \phi^{-1}\mqty(b_0 & b_1 \\ b_2 & b_3) \quad = \quad \quat{\frac{b_0 + b_3}{2}}{\qty(\frac{b_1 - b_2}{2})}{\qty(\frac{b_1 + b_2}{2})}{\qty(\frac{b_0 - b_3}{2})}. 
    \label{eq:inv_quat_isom}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Matrix \& split-quaternion properties} 
One of the powerful features of the mapping $\phi$ is that it maps natural properties of the split-quaternion to natural properties of the associated matrix. Hence, given that $A = \phi(a)$ with $a \in \spquaternions$ and $A \in \real^{2\times2}$, we have the following correspondence: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{sum of matrices} is equivalent to the \emph{sum of split-quaternion}. If $A = \phi(a)$ and $B = \phi(b)$, then
        $$ a + b = \phi^(A + B). $$
    \item The \emph{matrix multiplication} is equivalent to \emph{split-quaternion multiplication}. If $A = \phi(a)$ and $B = \phi(b)$, then
        $$ ab = \phi^(AB). $$
    \item The \emph{conjugate} of the split-quaternion maps to the \emph{adjugate} of the matrix:\footnote
        {The adjugate of a matrix is the transpose of its cofactor matrix. \cite{Verhaegen2007}}
        $$ \phi(\conj{a}) = \adjugate(A). $$
    \item The \emph{trace} of the matrix coincides with the \emph{real or scalar part} of the split-quaternion:
        $$ \scapart{a} = a_0 = \frac{\trace(A)}{2}. $$
    \item The \emph{determinant} of the matrix is equal to the \emph{squared norm} of the split-quaternion:
        $$ \mathscr{N}(a) = \det(A). $$
    \item The equivalence of the determinant and the split-quaternion norm suggests that the multiplicative inverse of a split-quaternion does not always exist: it must be nonzero. In that case, it is clear that
        $$ \phi\qty(a^{-1}) = A^{-1} \qquad \mathscr{N}(a) \neq 0. $$
    The determinant property also shows us what the regime will be of the product of two split-quaternions; this is shown in \cref{tab:multiplication_class}.
        \begin{table}[h!]
        \centering
        \caption{Regime transition under the action of split-quaternion multiplication. The timelike split-quaternions form a group under multiplication, the timelike and spacelike split-quaternions do not: timelike split-quaternions do not have an inverse and the spacelike split-quaternions are not closed.}
        \label{tab:multiplication_class}
        \begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
            \toprule
            $\times$ & \emph{space} & \emph{light} & \emph{time} \\[1mm]
            \hline
            \emph{space} & time  & light & space \\
            \emph{light} & light & light & light \\
            \emph{time} &  space & light & time \\
            \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
        \end{table}
    \item The eigenvalues of a $2\times2$-matrix can be expressed in terms of its trace and its determinant:
        $$ \lambda_A = \frac{\trace(A) \pm \sqrt{\trace^2(A) - 4\det(A)}}{2}.$$
        The argument of the square root is equal to the \emph{negative of the squared vector norm} of $a$. We therefore have:
        \begin{equation}
            \lambda_A = \frac{2a_0 \pm \sqrt{4 a_0^2 - 4\mathscr{N}(a)}}{2} = 
            \begin{cases}
                a_0 \pm \ii\norm{\vec{a}} & \vec{a} \text{ timelike},\\[1ex]
                a_0 \pm 0  & \vec{a} \text{ lightlike},\\[1ex]
                a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}} & \vec{a} \text{ spacelike}.\\
            \end{cases}
            \label{eq:quat_eigvals}
        \end{equation}
        Hence, the `real' (scalar) and the magnitude of the `imaginary' (vector) parts of the quaternion coincide with the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the matrix.

\paragraph{Lie groups and algebras} 
The algebra of $2\times2$-matrices (or equivalently, of the split-quaternions) also consitute the Lie algebra $\glalg{2}{\real}$ of the two-dimensional general linear group $\glgroup{2}{\real}$. Furthermore, the traceless matrices, or equivalently, the split-quaternions with zero real part form the subalgebra $\slalg{2}{\real}$ of the special linear group $\slgroup{2}{\real}$. These are the volume-preserving automorphisms on $\real^2$. Because in $\real^2$, volume and area coincide, the special linear group and the symplectic group $\spgroup{1}$ are equivalent. For higher dimensions, this is not the case: area preservation is generally a stronger condition than volume preservation. The Lie algebra elements of the symplectic group are called Hamiltonian matrices; therefore, split-quaternions without real part are referred to as \emph{Hamiltonian}.

\section{Split-quaternion representation of dynamical systems}
\label{sec:system_classification}
\subsection{The algebra of vector fields}
\label{ssec:vf_algebra}
The isomorphism between the split-quaternions and the algebra of two-dimensional square matrices exposed in the preceding section can be used to develop an alternative representation of linear dynamical systems. Indeed, an autonomous dynamical system is defined by a \emph{vector field} on the state space. If this vector field is a linear mapping from the state space into the tangent space, it can be represented by a matrix. 

\paragraph{Basis vector fields} The vector fields corresponding to two-dimensional linear dynamical systems form a vector space on their own, spanned (for example) by the four basis elements shown in \cref{eq:basis_elements}. Each of the basis elements $1,\,\quati,\,\quatj,\,\quatk$ corresponds to a specific `basis' vector field, denoted by $X_1$, $X_{\quati}$, $X_{\quatj}$ and $X_{\quatk}$ respectively. The basis vector fields are shown in \cref{fig:basis_vf}. 

The vector field element $X_1$, corresponding to the identity element is an infinitesimal dilation, while $X_{\quati}$ represents an infinitesimal clockwise rotation, and $X_{\quatj}$ and $X_{\quatj}$ are infinitesimal `squeeze mappings', hyperbolic rotations or \emph{Lorentz transformations} along two differents sets of principal axes. The binary operation of matrix multiplication translates to the composition of the vector fields.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/basis_vectorfields}
    \caption{Basis vector fields corresponding to the basis elements of the split-quaternions.}
    \label{fig:basis_vf}
\end{figure}

Apart from the multiplication operation for split-quaternions and matrices, we can also define the \emph{commutator} of a binary operation, which measures exactly by how much two elements fail to commute. For split-quaternions, matrices and vector fields the commutator is defined as (in that order): 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \liebr{a}{b} &= ab - ba,\quad a, b \in \spquaternions, \\
        \liebr{A}{B} &= AB - BA,\quad A, B \in \real^{2\times 2}, \\
        \liebr{X}{Y} &= \lied{X}{Y},\quad X,Y\in \vfields{M},
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
for some smooth manifold $M$ of the appropriate dimension. For vector fields, the commutator is also referred to as the \emph{Lie bracket} (it therefore defines the \emph{Lie algebra} $\slalg{2}{\real}$). The commutation relations (or \emph{structure constants}) for the basis vector fields are \cite{Schuller2014}
\begin{gather}
    \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quati}} = \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quatj}} = \liebr{X_1}{X_{\quatk}} = 0, \\
    \liebr{X_{\quati}}{X_{\quatj}} = 2X_{\quatk}, \qquad  
    \liebr{X_{\quati}}{X_{\quatk}} = -2X_{\quatj}, \qquad
    \liebr{X_{\quatj}}{X_{\quatk}} = -2X_{\quati}.
\end{gather}
Of course, these commutation relations are exactly the same for the corresponding split-quaternion or matrix basis elements. Scalar multiples of the identity element commute with every other element of the algebra; they are in the \emph{center} of the algebra. Importantly, the vector field $X_1$ and all its multiples commute with 
\emph{all} the other vector fields. This has important ramifications: it means that one can consider the action associated with those vector fields as completely separate from the action of the other vector field components, for they do not influence each other in the process. This fact will be used in \cref{sec:mechanical}.

\subsection{Classification of dynamical systems}
The classification of two-dimensional linear dynamical systems is important, for they also locally represent the fixed points of general nonlinear systems. Traditionally, this decomposition is done according to the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix matrix $A$, or equivalently, through a Poincaré diagram as shown in \cref{fig:poincare_diagram}. Because the split-quaternion norms are directly related to the real and imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix, we propose that the split-quaternion representation offers a more convenient alternative, based on their squared (vector) norm, on par with the regimes defined in \cref{tab:class_combinations}.

The corresponding split-quaternion regimes defined in \cref{tab:class_combinations} are displayed as well. The determinant axis coincides with the squared norm of the split quaternion being 0, while all the points on the parabolic line correspond to split-quaternions with zero \emph{vector} norm. A further distinction is made with the scalar part of the split-quaternion, which, for each of the regimes, determines (asymptotic) (in)stability.}

\subsubsection*{Spacelike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{1}] For spacelike split-quaternions, there is only one possibility: a negative split-quaternion norm corresponds to a negative determinant, which means that the fixed point is a \emph{saddle}. We can distinguish one particular case: if the scalar part of the split-quaternion is zero ($a_0 = 0$), the saddle is `balanced', and generates a proper \emph{squeeze mapping}, which is a symplectomorphism of the phase space. The split-quaternion is therefore Hamiltonian. An example of the latter is the linearization of the unstable fixed point of a rotational pendulum.
    \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Lightlike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{2}] \emph{Spacelike vector norm}: in this case, there is not just a fixed point but a fixed line in the phase space. This fixed line is stable or unstable depending on the sign of the scalar part of the quaternion. 
        \item[\circled{3}] \emph{Lightlike vector norm}: this case is degenerate to the second degree; it coincides with the origin in the Poincaré diagram. The associated vector field is purely translational. An example is an object in uniform motion.
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Timelike split-quaternion norm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\circled{4}] \emph{Spacelike vector norm}: this case gives rise to eigenvalues that are purely real; the fixed point is called a \emph{node}. Depending on the sign of the scalar part, the fixed point can be an unstable node or \emph{source} ($a_0 > 0$) or a stable node or \emph{sink} ($a_0 < 0$). An example of such a system is the overdamped harmonic oscillator.
        \item[\circled{5}] \emph{Lightlike vector norm}: In this case, the two eigenvalues are equal to each other. This can be seen from the expression of the vector norm in terms of the matrix properties: 
            $$ \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = \mathscr{N}(a - a_0) = \det(A - \frac{\trace(A)}{2}I). $$
        When the two eigenvalues are identical, $\trace(A) = 2\lambda$, the above expression necessarily vanishes and the split-quaternion therefore has a lightlike vector part. There are then two subcategories to be distinguished, depending on whether the matrix is diagonalizable or not:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If the matrix is diagonalizable, it \emph{must} be a scalar multiple of the identity \cite{Edwards2018}. This is because the rank of the matrix $ A - \lambda I$ must be equal to 0 for the eigenspace to be two-dimensional. The corresponding split-quaternion is then \emph{purely real}; i.e. $a = \lambda$. Because it has no vector part, the vector is then lightlike in the most trivial fashion. The associate fixed point is then a \emph{star}, which can either be stable or unstable depending on the sign of the real part (this particular case is not shown in \cref{fig:poincare_diagram}). 
            \item Conversely, if the vector norm is zero but the vector part not, the matrix is not diagonalizable for the reason mentioned above: the null space of $ A - \lambda I$ is one-dimensional, and can therefore not be spanned by two independent eigenvectors. The fixed point is an \emph{improper node}, which is again stable or unstable depending on the sign of the real part.
            %the eigenvalues of the associated matrix are real and equal; this type of fixed point is named a \emph{degenerate node}. More specifically, in the unstable case ($a_0 > 0$) it is called a \emph{degenerate source}, while in the stable case it is referred to as a \emph{degenerate sink}. An example is a critically damped harmonic oscillator. 
        \end{itemize}
        An example of this type of system is the critically damped harmonic oscillator.
        \item[\circled{6}] \emph{Timelike vector norm}: this really is the only general case where the eigenvalues of $A$ are complex. If $a_0 = 0$, the eigenvalues are imaginary and the fixed point is a \emph{center}. Again, for $a_0 > 0$ it is an \emph{unstable spiral node} and for $a_0 < 0$ a \emph{stable spiral node}. An example is an underdamped (or even undamped) harmonic oscillator.
    \end{itemize}

It is clear from the present discussion that the split-quaternions offer a very natural representation of linear dynamical sytems, and their natural properties translate directly to the classificaion of the qualitative behavior of these systems.

\subsection{The exponential function of split-quaternions}
Just like the concept of the exponential function was originally generalized for square matrices, we can do the same for split-quaternions in an analogous manner. As such, the \emph{split-quaternion exponential function} is defined as
$$ \exp(a) \equiv \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a^k}{k!} \qquad a \in \spquaternions.  $$
Because this definition is identical to the one for matrices, we may, as a result of the isomorphism defined in \cref{ssec:quat_isomorphism}, also expect the exact same result; i.e.
$$ \exp(a) = \phi^{-1}(\exp(\phi(a))) $$
where the second exponential function refers to the matrix exponential instead.

To evaluate the exponential function of a split-quaternion, let us first use the following property of the matrix exponential \cite{Hall2013}
$$ AB = BA \quad \Rightarrow \quad \exp(A + B), $$
i.e. we can only `split' the exponential of a sum if the two elements \emph{commute}. We can regard an arbitrary split-quaternion
$$ a = \quat{a_0}{a_1}{a_2}{a_3} $$
as the sum of $a_0$ and $\quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}$. The real part is distinguished from the other three parts in the sense that it commutes
with every other element (cf. \cref{ssec:vf_algebra}). We may therefore use the former property and apply it to the split-quaternion exponential as well:
$$ \exp(a) \, = \,\ec^{a_0}\,\exp(\quatvec{a_1}{a_2}{a_3}). $$
We therefore only have to be considered with the evaluation exponential of $\vec{a}$. To do so, observe that we can consider the vector part of a split-quaternion to be a split-quaternion in its own right, but with zero real part. This means that $ \conj{\vec{a}} = -\vec{a} $, and the squared vector norm is simply the negative of the square of the vector part:
$$ \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = \vec{a} \conj{\vec{a}} = -\vec{a}^2. $$
Let us now introduce the concept of \emph{unit split-quaternion vectors}, which are vector split-quaternions with a vector norm of $\pm 1$. The unit vector may be obained by normalization of the vector part:
$$ \hat{\vec{a}} = \frac{\vec{a}}{\sqrt{\abs{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}}} \qquad \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) \neq 0, $$
which squares to
$$ \hat{\vec{a}}^2 = - \mathscr{N}(\hat{\vec{a}}) 
                   = - \frac{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}{\abs{\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}} 
                   = - \sgn(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})).
$$
Normalizing lightlike vectors is not possible, because they have all the same length of zero: there is no point in making the distinction between vector and unit vector. Based on the regime of the vector part, three possiblities arise: \cite{Motter1998,Harkin2004}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $\vec{a}$ is timelike, then $\uvec{a}^2 = -1$. We can therefore say that the unit vector `behaves' like the imaginary unit $\ii$ ($\ii^2 = -1$). In general, we can identify the split-quaternion (with timelike vector part) $ a_0 + \norm{a}\uvec{a}$ with the \emph{complex number} $a_0 + \norm{\vec{a}}\ii$. 
    \item If $\vec{a}$ is lightlike, then $\vec{a}^2 = 0$, and the notion of the unit vector is not well-defined. Because the vector is nilpotent with degree 2, it is analogous to the nilpotent unit $\epsilon$ (for which we have that $\epsilon^2 = 0$). Split-quaternions with timelike vector part can be identified with the \emph{dual number} $a_0 + \epsilon$. 
    \item Finally, if $\vec{a}$ is spacelike, then $\uvec{a}^2 = 1$. The unit vector behaves like the idempotent unit $\jj$, with defining property $\jj^2 = 1$ ($\jj \notin \real$!).\footnote
        {Again, we must take care not to confuse the hyperbolic unit with the split-quaternion basis element $\quatj$. They behave the same, and are related in the sense that they give rise to `split' behavior, but are part of a very different number systems.}
        Likewise, a split-quaternion with spacelike vector part is analogous to the \emph{split-complex number} (or hyperbolic number) $a_0 + \norm{\vec{a}}\jj$.
\end{itemize}

The connection between split-quaternions the generalized complex numbers\footnote
{For a more detailed account of generalized complex numbers, the reader is referred to \citet{Harkin2004}.}
(i.e. complex, dual and split-complex)
sheds some additional light on the behavior of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix $A$ by means of the root locus plot (see \cref{eq:quat_eigvals}). A typical branch of the  root locus consists of a complex pole pair approaching the real axis when the gain is increased. When they finally collide on the real axis, they each go their opposite ways on the real axis, essentially breaking the symmetry with respect to the real axis. The split-quaternions and hypercomplex numbers paint a slightly more elegant picture, which is shown in \cref{fig:root_locus}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item As shown above, when the pole pair is complex, the associated split-quaternion vector is timelike. The eigenvalues are naturally conjugate with respect to the real axis, i.e.
        $$ \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}}\ii.$$
    \item When the pole pair collides on the real axis (often called the \emph{branch point}), the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is zero, and the vector is timelike. Observe that we can make the case that, because the branches continue afterwards in a separate manner, they cannot be \emph{exactly} the same. Indeed, the eigenvalues are
        $$ \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \epsilon.$$
        The nilpotent unit $\epsilon$ is often interpreted as a differential, or an infinitesimally small quantity.\footnote{A common application of dual numbers is automatic differentiation: because higher powers vanish, they can be used to generate first-order polynomial approximations. The unit `circle' for dual numbers consists of two vertical lines crossing the horizontal axis at $\pm 1$. These lines can again be interpreted as linear approximations of the actual unit circle (or unit hyperbola) associated to (split-)complex numbers. The plane spanned by the $\jj$-axis and the real axis is the split-complex plane. The `projection' to the real axis is in this plane a reflection with respect to the light cone (first diagonal).} We argue that in this case, the pole pair is still conjugate, but the poles differ only by an infinitesimal amount.
    \item When the gain is increased further, the poles are real and the symmetry with respect to the real axis is broken. However, we can infer from the preceding discussion that the imaginary part is now hyperbolic instead, i.e.
        $$ \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}}\jj. $$
        Of course, it is possible to project these points on the real axis, but this obscures the natural symmetry of the root locus branch. In \cref{fig:root_locus}, we therefore put the hyperbolic part on a third axis.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/root_locus}
    \caption{Generalized version of a root locus plot in terms of hypercomplex numbers. The traditional root locus is set in the complex $s$-plane (shown in blue), but we added a third axis for the hyperbolic part of the eigenvalue. When the gain is increased, the initially complex pole pair ventures towards the real axis. If the pole pair is critically damped, both poles are separated from the real axis by an infinitesimal distance of $\epsilon$. Increasing the gain even more pushes the pole pair into the hyperbolic regime (the associated split-quaternion vector is now spacelike). Observe that in this picture, the symmetry with respect to the real axis is preserved. In the traditional root locus, these points are projected onto the real axis, indicated by the dashed lines. }
    \label{fig:root_locus}
\end{figure}

Let us now return to the exponential function. We can manipulate the definition of $\exp(a)$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\;\qty(\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\vec{a}^k}{k!} ) \\
                &= \ec^{a_0}\;\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\qty(\vec{a}^2)^k}{(2k)!}  + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\vec{a}\qty(\vec{a}^2)^k}{(2k+1)!}]. \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, if $\vec{a}$ is not lightlike, we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \exp(a) = \ec^{a_0}\;\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}\, \qty(\uvec{a}^2)^k}{(2k)!}  + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1} \, \qty(\uvec{a}^2)^k}{(2k+1)!}].
\end{equation*}
Once again, there are three possibilities, depending on the regime of $\vec{a}$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $\vec{a}$ is \emph{timelike}, then the above expression reverts to
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}\,\qty(-1)^k}{(2k)!} + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1} \, \qty(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty\big[\cos(\norm{a})  + \uvec{a}\sin(\norm{a})]. \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        This is roughly equivalent to the Euler identity for complex numbers, which is not at all surprising, since we found before that $\uvec{a}$ can be associated with the imaginary unit if $\vec{a}$ is timelike.
    \item Secondly, if $\vec{a}$ is \emph{lightlike}, we can simply use the definition of the expontial in its original form: \footnote{We can also use the `split' expression, defining that $0^0 \equiv 1$, a common convention in power series and algebra. Observe that the trigonometric functions associated to the dual numbers (i.e. the lightlike vectors) are then equal to the small-angle approximation for $\sin$ and $\cos$. \cite{Graham1994, Harkin2004}}
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\,\sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \frac{\vec{a}^k}{k!}, \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[1 + \vec{a} + \sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{\vec{a}^{k-2}\vec{a}^2}{k!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty(1 + \vec{a}). \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
    \item Finally, if $\vec{a}$ is \emph{spacelike}, we have
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \exp(a) &= \ec^{a_0}\qty[\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k}}{(2k)!} 
                           + \uvec{a}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\norm{\vec{a}}^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}], \\
                        &= \ec^{a_0}\qty\big[\cosh(\norm{a}) + \uvec{a}\sinh(\norm{a})]. \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
The exponential map of a split-quaternion can be used to obtain the solution of the corresponding linear differential equation. For the linear ordinary differential equation
$$ \dv{\vec{x}}{t} = A\vec{x} $$
has the following solution \cite{Arnold1984}
$$ \vec{x}(t) = \exp(At)\vec{x}_0, $$
where the one-parameter group of transformations generated by $\exp(A t)$ is referred to as the \emph{flow} of the vector field $A\vec{x}$. Hence, for two-dimensional systems, the matrix $A$ can be represented by a split-quaternion, and we have just derived easy and insightful ways to evaluate its exponential: 
\begin{equation}
    \exp(a t) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty\big[\cos(\norm{\vec{a}} t) + \uvec{a}\sin(\norm{\vec{a}} t)] & $\vec{a}$ \text{ timelike}, \\[1.5ex]
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty(1 + \norm{\vec{a}}t ) & $\vec{a}$ \text{ lightlike}, \\[1.5ex]
        \phantom \quad \ec^{a_0 t}\qty\big[\cosh(\norm{\vec{a}} t) + \uvec{a}\sinh(\norm{\vec{a}} t)] & $\vec{a}$ \text{ spacelike}. \\[1.5ex]
    \end{cases}
    \label{eq:system_solution}
\end{equation}
Evaluating a matrix exponential by hand usually involves diagonalizing (strictly speaking, finding the Jordan form). The convenience of using split-quaternions instead resides in the fact that they resolve the ambiguity that is naturally present in the eigenvectors of the matrix $A$; especially when they are complex. In the next section, the relation between the eigenvectors and the unit vector $\uvec{a}$ are discussed in greater detail \cite{Moler2003}.
