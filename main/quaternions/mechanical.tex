\section{Application to mechanical systems}
\label{sec:mechanical}
We will now proceed by using a mechanical `prototype' example for our mechanical system: the harmonic oscillator with \emph{two} dampers: one in series and one in parallel, as discussed in \cref{ssec:serial_damping}. We consider a system with two dampers because the corresponding state transition matrix is completely `filled': as such, this system can represent all the possible two-dimensional systems discussed in the previous section. %Furthermore, the two dampers have a very distinctive interpretation within the field of economic engineering.

\subsection{Equations of motion}
The harmonic oscillator with two dampers is shown in \cref{fig:double_damped_osc}. 
%The equations of motion can be readily derived:
%\begin{equation}
%    \begin{split}
%        m\ddot{q}_1 &= -kq - b_p \dot{q}_1 \\
%        kq &= b_s(\dot{q}_1 - \dot{q}) \\
%    \end{split}
%\end{equation}
%Due to the presence of the serial damper, the situation is somewhat curious, since there are two positions in the system; one measuring the spring deflection $q$ and the position of the mass $q_1$. However, the node connecting the serial damper and the spring has no mass, and therefore no second-order dynamics: as such, the overall order of the system is 2. In accordance with the economic analogy, we will say that position is stored in the spring, but momentum is stored in a mass. Hence, let $p = m\dot{q}_1$ --- but $\dot{q} \neq p/m$ in general. 
The equations of motion of the harmonic oscillator with parallel and serial damping are given in \cref{eq:serial_eom_raw}. In matrix form, we have:
\begin{equation*}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \mqty(-\tfrac{k}{b_s} & \tfrac{1}{m} \\ -k & - \tfrac{b_p}{m})\mqty(q \\ p),
\end{equation*}
or, using the parameters defined in \cref{tab:ddho_params}:
\begin{equation}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \underbrace{\mqty(-\gamma_s & \frac{1}{m} \\ -m\Omega_n^2 & - \gamma_p)}_A \mqty(q \\ p).
    \label{eq:ddho_eom}
\end{equation}
%The nontrivial relation between momentum and the $\dot{q}$ also precludes us from casting this system directly to the Lagrangian formalism, because the vector field is not second-order. A second-order vector field implies that the `velocities' really are the time derivatives of the `positions', (cf. \cref{app:symplectic_geometry} for a more formal discussion).

The split-quaternion associated with the $A$-matrix of the doubly damped system can easily be found using the mapping defined by \cref{eq:inv_quat_isom}. We must, however, be careful when dealing with physical systems, because the entries of the $A$-matrix are not dimensionless. In a vector space, we associate the units with the basis vectors, not with the components. For example, in a two-dimensional vector space spanned by a axis for apples and and an axis for pears, and we wish to represent that someone possesses three apples and four pairs, the \emph{components} of that vector are $(3, 4)$, and the \emph{unit vectors} are $(1 \text{ apple}, 1\text{ pear})$. Along the same line, we must define the units in the $A$-matrix in the split-quaternion basis elements 1, \quati, \quatj, \quatk. To do so, we define the reference quantities and $m_0, t_0$. The basis elements are then mapped in terms of these reference quantities:
$$ 
    \phi(1) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & \tfrac{1}{t_0}), \quad 
    \phi(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  -\tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \quad
    \phi(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  \tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \quad
    \phi(\quatk) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & -\tfrac{1}{t_0}), \quad 
$$
where, in case we would use SI units, $m_0 = \SI{1}{\kilogram}$ and $t_0 = \SI{1}{\second}$. As a result, the split-quaternion associated with the $A$-matrix given in \cref{eq:ddho_eom} becomes
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_s + t_0\gamma_p)\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quati\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quatj\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_p - t_0\gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat_units}
\end{equation}
Clearly, all the components of the split-quaternion are dimensionless. This really is not too wild of an idea: after all, we are translating the matrix itself, and \emph{not} the two-dimensional vector space that it acts on. The units are inherited from the vector space, so we should only add them when returning from the split-quaterions back to the realm of the matrices. 

The preceding argument only explains why we can work around this issue without performing illegal operations, but it does not give a satisfactory answer as to why we would be interested to add numbers that are seemingly incompatible. Indeed, observe that $\gamma_s$ and $\gamma_p$ have the same units, whereas $\tfrac{1}{m}$ and $\Omega_n^2$ do not. So, in which sense can the $\quati$ and $\quatj$-components be of any signficance? To answer this question, we first note that `rescaling of units' is a linear operation on the vector space given by a diagonal matrix (with nonzero diagonal entries): 
$$ N = \mqty(\dmat[0]{\nu_1}{\nu_2}) \qquad \nu_1, \nu_2 \in \real^*, $$
which form the group isomorphic to $(\real^*)^2$. This transformation of the vector space manifests itself on the $A$-matrix as: $ A' = N^{-1}A N$. It is easy to see that the basis matrices (or vector fields) for `1' and \quatk are invariant under this transformation, while the \quati and \quatj-matrices are not (that is, without making use of the reference quantities). 

A geometric explanation is that the eigenvectors of the identity matrix and the \quatk-matrix point along the axes; and are therefore invariant under rescaling of these axes. As a result of this fact, the \quati and \quatj components will not transform properly under a unit transformation. It is common practice in physics to rescale the state space of the undamped harmonic oscillator as follows \cite{Dekker1981,Dedene1980}
$$ p \mapsto \frac{p}{m} \qquad q \mapsto m\Omega q, $$
such that the Hamiltonian reverts to a particularly convenient form. We can see that this is precisely the transformation that kills the \quatj-component of the split-quaternion. This would essentially resolve this `unit problem', because it only arises when we attempt to make the \emph{distinction} between the \quati and \quatj-component.

In contrast to common practice in physics, we are interested in the full range of geometrical properties that the trajectories in the phase plane can exhibit, including those that are not invariant under the action of the structure group $(\real^*)^2$ that contains the changes of units. Furthermore, many invariants, such as the split-quaternion (vector) norm, scalar part, etc. that we use to draw conclusions about the nature of the system \emph{do} commute with this group action, and are therefore remain valid. It is even possible to effect unit transformations within the split-quaternion transformations by translating the matrix $N$ to the appropriate split-quaternion using the isomorphism. We can indeed observe that the action of $n^{-1} a n$ (where $n = \phi^{-1}(N)$) produces a split-quaternion with zero $\quatj$-component. 

As a final argument, we can say that the `rescaling of the axes', while common in physics and mathematically allowed, is of little use for engineers, since they tend to stick to SI units in the first place. The `scale of the axes' is therefore a physical reality. This is why we choose not to discard the $\quatj$-component through a rescaling.

To conclude, it is not so much the case that unit transformations are not allowed in the split-quaternion space, but the question as to what the units of the \quatj-components are is moot. Unfortunately, the notation in \cref{eq:ddho_quat_units} is rather obfuscating. Hence, we take the freedom to choose $m_0 = 1 (\si{\kilogram})$ and $t_0 = 1 (\si{\second})$, and write the split-quaternion as follows:
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_s + \gamma_p)\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2)\quati\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2)\quatj\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_p - \gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat}
\end{equation}
This requires the implicit understanding that all the components are dimensionless, and that we are not just adding apples and pears. 

\subsection{Geometry of the solution trajectories}
As mentioned previously, the qualitative regime of the dynamical system can be deduced from the sign of its split-quaternion and vector norm. In the particular case of the harmonic oscillator with two dampers, we assume that the damping coefficients $\gamma_s, \gamma_p$ are either positive or zero and that mass $m$ and the spring constant $k$ are both strictly positive. The norm of the split-quaternion given in \cref{eq:ddho_quat} is
$$ \mathscr{N}(a) = m \Omega_n^2 + \gamma_p \gamma_s.$$
From this expression we find that, given the assumptions, the norm of $a$ is always positive, and that we are therefore always dealing with a timelike split-quaternion.

\paragraph{Real part} The real part of $a$ directly coincides with the real part of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ (cf. \cref{eq:quat_eigvals}). As can be observed from \cref{eq:system_solution}, the real part $a_0$ appears in the system solution as part of the argument of the exponential that envelopes the inner part of the solution, but not influencing it in any other fashion. This is a consequence of the fact that the vector fields proportional to $X_1$ commute with all the other vector fields. In the context of the mechanical system, this means that one can first apply all the rotations to the system, and then all the damping to end up with the same solution. This is not the case for the other basis vector fields. As a result, it makes sense to look at the real part and the vector part separately, for they act `in parallel' on the system.

In the context of the mechanical system, the real part $a_0 = \gamma_s + \gamma_p$ represents the combined effect of the two dampers or \emph{net dissipation}. Recall that the other three basis vector fields $X_\quati$, $X_\quatj$ and $X_\quatk$ are Hamiltonian and therefore conserve the energy in the system. As such, removing this effect from the system is the same as removing the overall effect of dissipation, which results the conservative version of the original system. This is not to say that there is no influence of the dampers whatsoever: the $\quatk$-component measures the imbalance between the two dampers, which results in a phase shift in the system.

\paragraph{Vector norm} The vector part of $a$ is three-dimensional. It lives in a three-dimensional vector space with a Lorentzian norm (denoted by $\real^{1, 2}$), in the form of the vector norm. For the mechanical system, the vector norm is equal to 
$$ \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = m\Omega^2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_p + \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s \gamma_p. $$
The vector norm is equal the square of the `imaginary part' of the eigenvalues of $A$. In the context of the damped harmonic oscillator, this imaginary part is often referred to as the \emph{damped frequency} $\Omega_d$. 

As mentioned in \cref{sec:system_classification}, the sign of the vector norm determines the regime of the mechanical system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) > 0$ (timelike vector), the system is underdamped (or undamped); 
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = 0$ (lightlike vector), the system is critically damped; 
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0$ (spacelike vector), the system is overdamped.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Normalized vector} We now wish to dissect the structure of the two-dimensional system even further by removing influence the vector norm as well, looking at the \emph{normalized} vector part. Since this removes precisely the information contained in the eigenvalues of the system, we expect to end up with the split-quaternion equivalent of the \emph{eigenvectors} of the associated matrix $A$. The real part of the split-quaternion, or the trace of the matrix, does not influence the eigenvectors of the matrix either. This can be observed from the following expression
$$ (A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = \qty[(A + s I) - ((s + \lambda) I) \gamma I)]\vec{v}, $$
i.e. adding any scalar multiple of the identity to the matrix adds this scalar to the value of all the eigenvalues, and leaves the eigenvectors unaltered.

The following diagram provides a summary of the structure of the split-quaternion representation, and how the different components manifest themselves in the behavior of the system. The assumptions is made that we are dealing either with a spacelike or timelike vector, and that therefore the normalized vector part is well-defined.

    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Normalized vector in the Lorentzian space} Since two degrees of freedom have been removed from what was originally a four-dimensional, the normalized vector part lives in a two-dimensional space. Embedded in the Lorentz space, the normalized vector parts are lie in a collection of disconnected surfaces, depending on their regime:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is timelike, the unit vectors live on the \emph{two-sheet unit hyperboloid}:
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 1};$$
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is lightlike, the vectors live on the \emph{light cone} (normalizing these vector is not possible):
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 0}; $$
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is spacelike, the vectors live on the \emph{one-sheet unit hyperboloid}:
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = -1}. $$
\end{itemize}
These three surfaces (two-sheet hyperboloid, one-sheet hyperboloid and the light cone) are shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloids}. 

Since the regime of the mechanical system is determined by its vector norm, we can locate underdamped systems on the two-sheet hyperboloid, overdamped systems on the one-sheet hyperboloid and critically damped systems on the light cone. These surfaces are aligned along the $\quati$-axis.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{media/other/lorentz_space.png}
    \caption{The disconnected `unit sphere' in the Lorentzian 3-space. The blue surface is the one-sheet hyperboloid, containing all the spacelike unit vectors representing overdamped mechanical systems. The gray sheet is the light cone, that contains all the lightlike `null' vectors with zero norm, representing critically damped systems. Finally, the red surfaces constitute the two-sheet hyperboloid, which is the space of all timelike unit vectors, representing underdamped (or undamped) systems.}
    \label{fig:hyperboloids}
\end{figure}

The eigenvalues represent a (composite) frequency of the system: they tell how fast the states evolve along the solution trajectories. The shape of the trajectories (given a certain regime) is encoded in the eigenvectors of the system. Hence, a certain point on each of the three surfaces shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloids} coincide with a trajectory shape, once the overall effect of damping is removed (real part), and disregarding the time parametrization along that trajectory (vector norm).

For the harmonic oscillator with two dampers, the unit vector is equal to:
$$ \uvec{a} \:= \:\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})\quati \: + \:\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})\quatj \:+ \:\qty(\frac{\gamma_p - \gamma_s}{2\Omega_d})\quatk,$$
with $\Omega_d$ being the damped frequency of the oscillator
$$ \Omega_d = \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{m\Omega^2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_p + \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s \gamma_p} $$

We will now investigate the relation between the normalized vector part and the shape of the solution trajectories in each of the three cases (underdamped, critically damped and overdamped) in more detail.

\subsubsection{Underdamped systems}
For underdamped systems, the trajectories are spiral-shaped. Removing the real part is the same as removing the `contraction' in the spiral: as a result, the conservative version of this trajectory is an elliptic trajectory. This ellipse is subject to the same stretch and tilt of the original spiral, as illustrated by \cref{fig:underdamped}. 

The shape of the ellipse is completely determined by a measure of its eccentricity and a rotation angle (i.e. the angle between its major axis and the horizontal axis). The radius of the trajectory depends on the amount of energy present in the system and is therefore not a shape factor that is specific to the system.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/underdamped}
    \caption{Solution trajectories and vector field of an exemplary underdamped system. The red trajectories are the actual solution of the system, while the blue trajectories are the `convervative' version, i.e. with the real part of the split-quaternion removed.}
    \label{fig:underdamped}
\end{figure}

Every point on the two-sheet hyperboloid represents a specific elliptical trajectory with a certain rotation angle and eccentricity. Any point on the two-sheet unit hyperboloid is most conveniently expressed in \emph{pseudospherical coordinates}: a rotation angle $\sigma$ and a hyperbolic angle $\tau$ \cite{Balazs1986}. In special relativity, the hyperbolic angle is typically called a \emph{boost}. For an arbitrary timelike unit vector part of a split-quaternion 
$$ \uvec{a} = \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quati + \frac{a_2}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quatj + \frac{a_3}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quatk, $$
these angles are defined by the following relations:
$$ a_1 = \norm{\vec{a}}\cosh(\tau) \qquad a_2 = \norm{\vec{a}}\sinh(\tau) \cos(\sigma) \qquad a_3 = \norm{\vec{a}}\sinh(\tau) \sin(\sigma). $$
It is easily verified that the components indeed satisfy the relation
$$ \mathscr{N}(\uvec{a}) = a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 1. $$
Furthermore, we have the following relations:
\begin{equation} 
    \begin{array}{cc}
        \displaystyle \cosh(\tau) = \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}, \quad & \quad 
        \displaystyle \sinh(\tau) = \frac{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}{\norm{\vec{a}}}, \\[0.5cm]
        \displaystyle \cos(\sigma) = \frac{a_2}{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}, \qquad & \quad
        \displaystyle \sin(\sigma) = \frac{a_3}{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}. 
    \end{array}
    \label{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}
\end{equation}

We will now try to relate the location of the normalized vector part on the two-sheet hyperboloid to the geometric features of the elliptic solution trajectories. To do so, we can use the solution trajectories of the basis vector fields, and build the solution for the system based on the vector components. For the $X_\quati$, the solution curves have the implicit form 
$$ \tfrac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) = C, $$
i.e. they are concentric circles of some radius. Secondly, for $X_\quatj$, we have the implicit form
$$ \tfrac{1}{2}(p^2 - q^2) = C.  $$
Thirdly, for $X_\quatk$, the solution trajectories are of the form
$$ pq = C. $$

From the above expression we can find the shape of the actual solution trajectory by weighing each of these curves with the respective components of the normalized vector part:
$$ \frac{a_1}{2\norm{\vec{a}}}\qty(q^2 + p^2)  + \frac{a_2}{2\norm{\vec{a}}}\qty(p^2 - q^2) + \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}pq = C. $$
Because we are not interested in the specific radius of the ellipse, we may multiply this expression by any nonzero factor. We have the following expression 
\begin{equation}
    \underbrace{(a_1 - a_2)}_{R} q^2 + \underbrace{2 a_3}_{S} pq + \underbrace{(a_1 + a_2)}_{T} p^2 = 2\norm{a}C,
    \label{eq:ellipse_equation}
\end{equation}
which is the implicit equation for an ellipse in case $S^2 - 4RT < 0$ \cite{Rapp1991}. Substitution shows that this condition is equivalent to $\vec{a}$ being timelike.

\paragraph{Eccentricity} The eccentricity of the ellipse given by \cref{eq:ellipse_equation} is equal to \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        e &= \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}{(R + T) + \sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}} \\
          &= \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{q_2^2 + q_3^2}}{q_1 + \sqrt{q_2^2 + q_3^2}}}. \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:eccentricity}
\end{equation}
Using the relations stated in \cref{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}, this expression can be written in terms of the pseudospherical coordinates:
$$ e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sinh{\tau}}{\cosh{\tau} + \sinh{\tau}}}. $$

\section{Notes}
! orthogonal refers to `regular' orthogonal, Lorentz-orthogonal makes the distinction.

Motivation: $\vec{u}$ seems to be `aligned' with major direction of the elliptic trajectory in the Lorentz-orthogonal subspace, generated by the action of its cross-product. Show this formally by making use of the eigenvectors.

The basis vectors $ \qty{\vec{e}_2, \vec{e}_3}$, where $\vec{e}_2$ is the orthogonal projection of the vector $\vec{e}_1 = \uvec{u}$ on its Lorentz-orthogonal subspace, and $\vec{e}_3 \triangleq \lorcrossp{\vec{e}_1}{\vec{e}_2}$, form the real and imaginary parts of two of the eigenvectors of the matrix $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$. 

Because the basis vectors $\vec{e}_2$ and $\vec{e}_3$ are also orthogonal in the Euclidean sense, the 

\begin{proof}
    Let $\uvec{u} = u_1\uvec{i} + u_2\uvec{j} + u_3\uvec{k}$. A normal vector to the Lorentz-orthogonal subspace is $
    \uvec{n} = u_1\uvec{i} - u_2\uvec{j} - u_3\uvec{k}$. Then, the basis vectors are
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \vec{e}_2 &= 
            \uvec{u} - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \uvec{n} \\
            \vec{e}_3 &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2} = -\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}}),
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    because the Lorentz-cross product distributes over addition and $\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{u}} = \vec{0}$. The proposition above claims that $\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$. Hence, it must be the case that $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3) = \lambda(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3)$, where $\lambda$ is then an eigenvalue of the matrix. This can be verified by replacing the action of $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$ with the cross product. Plugging in the definition and exploiting the linearity of the Lorentz cross-product, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3)} 
            &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2} +
        \ii\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_3}) \\
            &= \vec{e}_3 + \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_3})\ii \\ 
            &=\vec{e}_3 +  \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2})})\ii \\
            &=\vec{e}_3 -  \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}})})\ii.  \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
The triple cross-product expansion, or `Lagrange formula', relates the regular cross product to the corresponding dot product:
    $$ \vec{a}\times\qty(\vec{b}\times\vec{c}) = \vec{b}\:\inner{\vec{c}}{\vec{a}} - \vec{c}\:\inner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}. $$
This well-known identity generalizes (easily verified) to the Lorentzian counterpart of the cross- and inner products:
    $$ 
        \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\vec{b}}{\vec{c}})} 
       = \vec{b}\:\lorinner{\vec{c}}{\vec{a}} - \vec{c}\:\lorinner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}. 
    $$
Using the Lagrange formula, the above expression becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            & \vec{e}_3 - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\uvec{u}\,\lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} - \uvec{n}\lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{u}})\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \qty(\uvec{u}\,\frac{ \lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} \, \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \qty(\uvec{u} - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \vec{e}_2\ii. 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The latter is the scalar multiple of the vector $\vec{e}_2 + \vec{e}_3$ by $-\ii$ - hence, this is indeed an eigenvector of the corresponding matrix.
\end{proof}
Because $\vec{e}_2$ and $\vec{e}_3$ are also orthogonal in the normal sense, they are aligned with the major axes of the elliptic trajectories generated by the cross product. Hence, they can be used to find a basis of the invariant subspace which makes the trajectories identical to those in the phase plane.
