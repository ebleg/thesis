\section{Application to mechanical systems}
\label{sec:mechanical}
We will now proceed by using a mechanical prototypical example instead of the generic dynamical system of the preceding section. This mechanical system is the harmonic oscillator with two dampers: one in series and one in parallel, as discussed in \cref{ssec:serial_damping}. The reason for this particular mechanical system is twofold: first, it helps to establish the connection between this chapter and \cref{chap:geometric_structures}, and second, it allows us to gain a physical intuition behind the split-quaternion representation. 

Furthermore, the oscillator with two dampers is chosen because the extra damper fills the one entry in the corresponding state matrix that would otherwise remain zero in the case of the conventional damped harmonic oscillator. Therefore, this system can represent (in theory) all the possible two-dimensional systems discussed in the previous section.

\subsection{Equations of motion}
The harmonic oscillator with two dampers is shown in \cref{fig:double_damped_osc}, and its equations of motion are given by \cref{eq:serial_eom_raw}. In matrix form, the equations of motion are:
\begin{equation*}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \mqty(-\tfrac{k}{b_s} & \tfrac{1}{m} \\ -k & - \tfrac{b_p}{m})\mqty(q \\ p).
\end{equation*}
Alternatively, using the parameters \(\gamma_p \coloneq b_p/m\), \(\gamma_s \coloneq k/b_s\), and \(\Omega_n \coloneq \sqrt{k/m}\), we have the following:
\begin{equation}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \underbrace{\mqty(-\gamma_s & \frac{1}{m} \\ -m\Omega_n^2 & - \gamma_p)}_A \mqty(q \\ p).
    \label{eq:ddho_eom}
\end{equation}

Although the above state matrix can represent all possible linear two-dimensional systems \emph{in theory}, we will make some assumptions regarding the parameters in order to enforce that the system is indeed an actual oscillator:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*), align=left, leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item The damping coefficients are larger than or equal to zero: $\lambda_s \geq 0, \lambda_p \geq 0$;
    \item The mass is strictly positive: $m > 0$;
    \item The spring constant is strictly positive: $k > 0$.
\end{enumerate}
These assumptions imply that the determinant of the matrix given in \cref{eq:ddho_eom} is strictly larger than zero, which precludes the fixed point from being a saddle \circled{1}, an (un)stable line \circled{2} or uniform motion \circled{3}. Furthermore, because the damping is positive of zero, the system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov (i.e. the solutions are at least bounded).

The split-quaternion associated with the state matrix of the doubly damped system can easily be found using the mapping defined by \cref{eq:inv_quat_isom}. We must, however, be careful when dealing with physical systems, because the entries of the \(A\)-matrix are not dimensionless. 

In a vector space, units are associated with the basis vectors, not with the vector components. For example, consider a two-dimensional vector space spanned by an axis for apples and and an axis for pears. If we wish to represent that someone possesses three apples and four pears, the \emph{components} of that vector are \((3, 4)\), and the \emph{unit vectors} are \((1 \text{ apple}, 1\text{ pear})\). 

Along the same line, we must define the units in the state matrix in the split-quaternion basis elements 1, \quati, \quatj, \quatk. To do so, define the reference quantities \(m_0\) and \(t_0\). The basis elements are then mapped in terms of these reference quantities:
\begin{gather}
    \phi\qty(1) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & \tfrac{1}{t_0}), \qquad 
    \phi\qty(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  -\tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \\
    \phi\qty(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  \tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \qquad
    \phi\qty(\quatk) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & -\tfrac{1}{t_0}).
\end{gather}
If we would use SI units, \(m_0 = \SI{1}{\kilogram}\) and \(t_0 = \SI{1}{\second}\). 

Using these reference quantities, the split-quaternion associated with the state matrix given in \cref{eq:ddho_eom} becomes
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_s + t_0\gamma_p)1\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quati\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quatj\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_p - t_0\gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat_units}
\end{equation}
Clearly, all the components of the split-quaternion are dimensionless. This really is not too wild of an idea: after all, the split-quaternion represents the matrix itself, and \emph{not} the two-dimensional vector space that it acts on. The units are inherited from the vector space, so we should add them only when returning from the split-quaternions back to the realm of the matrices. 

The preceding argument only explains why we can work around this issue without performing illegal operations, but it does not give a satisfactory answer as to why we would be interested to add numbers that are seemingly incompatible. Indeed, observe that \(\gamma_s\) and \(\gamma_p\) have the same units, whereas \(\tfrac{1}{m}\) and \(\Omega_n^2\) do not. So, in which sense can the \(\quati\) and \(\quatj\)-components be of any significance? To answer this question, note that the rescaling of units is a linear transformation on the vector space given by a diagonal matrix (with nonzero diagonal entries): 
\begin{equation}
     N = \mqty(\dmat[0]{\nu_1}{\nu_2}) \qquad \nu_1, \nu_2 \in \real^*.
\end{equation}
These matrices form the group isomorphic to \((\real^*)^2\). This transformation of the vector space manifests itself on the \(A\)-matrix as 
\begin{equation} 
    A' = N^{-1}A N.
\end{equation}
It is easy to see that the basis matrices (or vector fields) for 1 and \quatk are invariant under this transformation, while the \quati and \quatj-matrices are not (that is, without making use of the reference quantities). 

A geometric explanation is that the eigenvectors of the identity matrix and the \quatk-matrix point along the axes, and are therefore invariant under rescaling of these axes. As a result of this fact, the \quati and \quatj components will not transform properly under a unit transformation. For example, it is common practice in physics to rescale the state space of the undamped harmonic oscillator as follows \cite{Dekker1981,Dedene1980}
\begin{equation}
     p \mapsto \frac{p}{m} \qquad q \mapsto m\Omega_n q,
\end{equation}
such that the Hamiltonian reverts to the standard quadratic form $\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(q^2 + p^2)$. This is precisely the transformation that removes the \quatj-component of the split-quaternion. This would essentially resolve this unit problem, because it only arises when we attempt to make the \emph{distinction} between the \quati and \quatj-component.
However, we are interested in the full range of geometrical properties that the trajectories in the phase plane can exhibit, including those that are not invariant under the action of the structure group \((\real^*)^2\). %Furthermore, many invariants, such as the split-quaternion (vector) norm, scalar part, etc. that we use to draw conclusions about the nature of the system \emph{do} commute with this group action, and are therefore remain valid. It is even possible to effect unit transformations within the split-quaternion transformations by translating the matrix \(N\) to the appropriate split-quaternion using the isomorphism. We can indeed observe that the action of \(n^{-1} a n\) (where \(n = \phi^{-1}(N)\)) produces a split-quaternion with zero \(\quatj\)-component. 

As a final argument, we can say that the rescaling of the axes, while common in physics and mathematically allowed, is of little use for engineers, since they tend to stick to SI units in the first place. The scale of the axes is therefore a physical reality. This is why we choose not to discard the \(\quatj\)-component by rescaling.

To conclude, it is not so much the case that unit transformations are not allowed in the split-quaternion space, but the question as to what the units of the \quatj-components are is moot. Unfortunately, the notation in \cref{eq:ddho_quat_units} is rather obfuscating. Hence, we take the freedom to choose \(m_0 = 1 (\si{\kilogram})\) and \(t_0 = 1 (\si{\second})\), and write the split-quaternion as follows:
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_s + \gamma_p)\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2)\quati\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2)\quatj\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_p - \gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat}
\end{equation}
Leaving out the reference quantities requires the silent understanding that all the components are dimensionless, and that we are not just adding apples and pears. 

In the next section, we investigate the influence that each of the split-quaternion components has on the physical behavior of the mechanical system.

\subsection{Physical interpretation of the split-quaternion representation}
In this section, we look at various aspects of the split-quaternion representation and relate them to the physical properties of the oscillator described in the previous section. 

\subsubsection{Squared total norm}
The squared total norm of the split-quaternion given in \cref{eq:ddho_quat} is equal to 
\begin{equation}
     \mathscr{N}(a) = m \Omega_n^2 + \gamma_p \gamma_s.
\end{equation}
The assumptions made earlier regarding the sign of $m, k, \lambda_s$ and $\lambda_p$ ensure that this is a positive number, which is to say that the split-quaternion $a$ as a whole is timelike.

The squared total norm can be interpreted as the \emph{effective potential energy} in the system. Indeed, when there is no damping, $\mathscr{N}(a) = m\Omega_n^2 $, i.e. the spring constant of the oscillator. The second term appears only if both $\gamma_p$ \emph{and} $\gamma_s$ are nonzero. This is because the presence of both dampers introduces a phase shift in the damping. Whereas the parallel damper dissipates in proportion the momentum $p$, the serial damper damps in proportion to the position $q$. Hence, their combined presence shifts the phase of the damping action in the cycle of the oscillator. The term $\gamma_p \gamma_s$ can be seen as a correction term to take into account this phase shift, if one where to express the equation entirely in terms of the position of the mass (cf. \cref{eq:serial_eom_raw}).

\subsubsection{Real part} 
The real part of the split-quaternion representation of the harmonic oscillator with two dampers is (cf. \cref{eq:ddho_quat}),
\begin{equation}
     a_0 = -\tfrac{1}{2}(\gamma_s + \gamma_p).
\end{equation}
This real part therefore represents the \emph{combined effect of both dampers}.

As can be observed from \cref{eq:system_solution} and \cref{fig:basis_vf}, the real part \(a_0\) appears in the system solution as part of the argument of the exponential that envelopes the inner part of the solution, but it does not influence it in any other fashion. This is a consequence of the fact that the vector fields proportional to \(X_1\) commute with all the other vector fields, as discussed in \cref{ssec:vf_algebra}. 

In the context of the mechanical system, this commuting of vector fields means that the overall transformation of the state-space that is generated by the vector field can be seen as the composition of two separate transformations. 

The first is a purely exponential contraction of the phase space (assuming \(\gamma_s, \gamma_p > 0\)), which is the overall effect of the dampers. We call this transformation \emph{nonconservative}, for it removes mechanical energy from the system. 

Second, we have the remaining transformation that is generated by the overall effect of the vector part \(\vec{a}\). The latter cannot be decomposed into separate \(\quati\), \(\quatj\) and \(\quatk\) \emph{transformations}, because the vector fields that generate them do not commute. The transformations generated by the vector part of \(a\) are \emph{conservative} (in contrast to the exponential contraction): this decomposition of the transformations therefore amounts to separating the dissipative and conservative effects in present in the mechanical system. That is to say, we decompose the system solution into two parts:
\begin{equation}
     \exp(a t) = \underbrace{\exp(a_0 t)}_{\text{\tiny dissipative}} \: \underbrace{\exp(\vec{a} t)}_{\text{\tiny conservative}}.
\end{equation}

From the above expression, it can be seen that the dissipative component of the solution is rather simple: it is simply a contraction by \(\ec^{a_0t } = \ec^{-(\gamma_s + \gamma_p)t}\). This is why we will now focus exclusively on the nature of the second transformation, being the conservative part. From the split-quaternion point of view, this means that we assume that the real part vanishes, and only take the vector part into account.

\subsubsection{Vector part} 
The vector part of \(a\) has three components. Based on the associated basis vector fields shown in \cref{fig:basis_vf} and \cref{eq:ddho_quat}, the following observations can be made
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \quati-component of the split-quaternion gives rise to a rotational vector field that is rotationally symmetric, since the solution trajectories are concentric circles. A positive component gives rise to a clockwise rotation. For the mechanical system, this component is equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2)\); it induces the \emph{oscillatory} or \emph{periodic motion} of the harmonic oscillator.
    \item The \quatj-component of the split-quaternion is a hyperbolic (saddle) vector field, its solution trajectories are hyperbolae whose asymptotes are the diagonals of the phase plane. For the mechanical system, this component is equal to \(\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2)\): it measures the \emph{imbalance between the two terms that constitute the rotation}. As a result, the combination of the \(\quati\) and \(\quatj\)-components is an ellipse that is stretched or squeezed along its primary axes, but \emph{not} rotated. The undamped harmonic oscillator is of this type.
    \item Finally, the \quatk-component is also a hyperbolic (saddle) vector field whose asymptotes are the horizontal and vertical axis. For the mechanical system, the \(\quatk\)-component is equal to the \emph{imbalance between the two dampers}, i.e. \(\frac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_p - \gamma_s)\). It also gives rise to a stretch and squeeze of the trajectory, but now along the diagonals of the phase plane. Therefore, it results in a \emph{phase shift} or `wobble' in the trajectory.
\end{itemize}
The influence of the vector components on the shape of the solution trajectories is visualized in \cref{fig:vector_components}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/vector_components}
    \caption{Comparison between the influence of the \(\quatj\)-component (left) and \(\quatk\)-component on the integral curves of \(X_\quati\). The \(\quatj\) component stretches the elliptic trajectory along the horizontal axis and squeezes it by the same amount in the vertical direction, while the \(\quatk\) component does the same but along axes that are rotated by 45 degrees. As shown by the figures, this is a consequence of the constructive or destructive interference of those vector fields in these particular directions.}
    \label{fig:vector_components}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Squared vector norm}
The vector norm of a split-quaternion is equal to the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the associated matrix. For the harmonic oscillator with two dampers represented by the split-quaternion in \cref{eq:ddho_quat}, the squared vector norm is equal to 
\begin{equation}
    \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = \Omega^2_n - \tfrac{1}{4}\qty(\gamma_s^2 + \gamma_p^2) + \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s \gamma_p = \Omega^2_n - \qty(\tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_p)^2.
\end{equation}
Provided that the full system exhibits dissipation, i.e. (\(\gamma_s + \gamma_p > 0\)), the sign of the squared vector norm determines the regime of the mechanical system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) > 0\) (timelike vector), the system is \emph{underdamped} (or undamped); 
    \item if \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = 0\) (lightlike vector), the system is \emph{critically damped}; 
    \item if \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0\) (spacelike vector), the system is \emph{overdamped}.
\end{itemize}
This can also be explained in terms of the \emph{damping ratio} \(\zeta\) of the system. Recall that the eigenvalues of the matrix associated to the split quaternion are given by
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_A = a_0 \pm \norm{\vec{a}}\ii.
\end{equation}
The \emph{damping ratio} is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \zeta \coloneq \frac{\Re(\lambda_A)}{\abs{\lambda_A}} = \frac{a_0}{\sqrt{a_0^2 + \mathscr{N}(\vec{a})}}.
\end{equation}
Hence, if \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a})\) vanishes (provided that the system is indeed damped, so \(a_0 \neq 0\)), then \(\zeta = 1\) and the system is critically damped. Likewise, if \(\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) > 0\) we have that \(\zeta < 1\) and the system is underdamped (and vice versa).

More generally, one can see that the vector norm measures whether either the `circular' \(\quati\)-component is dominant, or otherwise the combination of \(\quatj\) and \(\quatk\). In the former case, the solution trajectory is elliptic, while in the latter case it is hyperbolic.

\paragraph{Normalized vector part} 
By looking only at the vector part of the split-quaternion in \cref{eq:ddho_quat}, we have removed the real part from the eigenvalues of the associated matrix. The remaining vector part corresponds to the conservative component of the vector field. To show that the real part of the split-quaternion does not influence the eigenvectors of the matrix, observe that
\begin{equation}
     (A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = \big[(A + s I)  - (s + \lambda) I\big]\vec{v}.
     \label{eq:eigvec_realpart}
\end{equation}
This implies that adding any scalar multiple of the identity to the matrix adds this scalar to the value of all the eigenvalues, and leaves the eigenvectors unaltered. Since removing the real part of the split-quaternion corresponds to subtracting a multiple of the identity from the associated matrix, we can see that this does not affect the eigenvectors.

Furthermore, if we normalize the vector part, the vector norm is taken out of the equation as well: since it is equal to the imaginary part of the eigenvalue, what remains are the \emph{eigenvectors} (in alternative form) of the associated matrix.

As discussed in \cref{ssec:quat_basics}, the vector part of a split-quaternion lives in a three-dimensional Lorentzian space $\real^{1, 2}$ with basis \((\quati, \quatj, \quatk)\). Because the squared vector (Lorentzian) norm is indefinite, we can distinguish three possible normalizations (cf. \cref{ssec:exponential}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{timelike} vectors have a positive squared norm, and their normalized length is 1;
    \item \emph{lightlike} vectors have a squared norm of zero, they cannot be normalized;
    \item \emph{spacelike} vectors have a negative squared norm, their normalized length is -1.
\end{itemize}
These normalized (if not lightlike) vectors live on three disconnected subspaces of $\real^{1, 2}$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{timelike}, its normalized vector $\uvec{a}$ lives on the \emph{two-sheet unit hyperboloid}, which is the subspace defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 1}.
        \end{equation}
        This space consists of two separate sheets, referred to as the positive and negative sheet, depending on the sign of the \(\quati\)-component.
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{lightlike}, it cannot be normalized: it lives on the \emph{light cone}, which is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 0}.
        \end{equation}
    \item If \(\vec{a}\) is \emph{spacelike}, its normalized vector $\uvec{a}$ lives on the \emph{one-sheet unit hyperboloid}, which is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = -1}.
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
These three subspaces are visualized in \cref{fig:hyperboloids}. 

Because the vector norm determines the regime of the damped mechanical system, we can state that the two-sheet hyperboloid contains all the normalized underdamped systems, the light cone contains all the critically damped systems and the one-sheet hyperboloid contains all the normalized overdamped systems.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{media/other/hyperboloid.pdf}
    \caption{The disconnected `unit sphere' in the Lorentzian 3-space. The red surface is the one-sheet hyperboloid, containing all the spacelike unit vectors, or overdamped systems. The gray sheet is the light cone, that contains all the lightlike `null' vectors with zero norm, or critically damped systems. Finally, the two blue surfaces constitute the two-sheet hyperboloid, or underdamped systems.}
    \label{fig:hyperboloids}
\end{figure}

In the next section, we analyze the significance of the normalized vector part in greater detail for the case of an underdamped system.

\subsection{Geometric analysis of underdamped systems}
In this section, the normalized vector part $\uvec{a}$ is related to the specific shape of the integral curves of the dynamical system. The discussion is limited to underdamped systems, i.e. systems for which the split-quaternion vector part is timelike. 
For these systems, the trajectories are spiral-shaped. Removing the real part from the split-quaternion eliminates the exponential contraction in the spiral. As a result, the conservative version of this trajectory is an elliptic trajectory. This ellipse is subject to the same stretch and tilt of the original spiral, as illustrated by \cref{fig:underdamped}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/underdamped}
    \caption{Solution trajectories and vector field of an exemplary underdamped system. The green trajectories are the actual solution of the system, while the blue trajectories are the convervative version, i.e. with the real part of the split-quaternion removed.}
    \label{fig:underdamped}
\end{figure}

For underdamped systems, the eigenvectors are complex. This obscures the direct geometric implications of the eigenvectors on the integral curves, in contrast to other types of fixed points for which the eigenvectors are real (e.g. saddle points or nodes). Within the set of complex eigenvectors (all a complex multiple of each other), there is one specific set for which the real and imaginary part of the eigenvectors are orthogonal. In that particular case, the real and imaginary part of the eigenvectors coincide with the principal axes of the elliptic integral curves. Hence, one must first find the right set of eigenvectors in order to gain insights regarding shape of the integral curves \cite{Edwards2018}.

We argue that the split-quaternion representation, specifically its normalized vector part, offers a more efficient way to extract the geometric information about the integral curves --- in particular when the eigenvectors are complex.

For an underdamped system, the normalized vector is given by
\begin{equation}
    \uvec{a} \:= \:\underbrace{\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})}_{\hat{a}_1}\quati \: 
                 + \:\underbrace{\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})}_{\hat{a}_2}\quatj \: 
                 + \:\underbrace{\qty(\frac{\gamma_p - \gamma_s}{2\Omega_d})}_{\hat{a}_3}\quatk.
    \label{eq:ddho_vector}
\end{equation}
Here, \(\Omega_d\) is the \emph{damped frequency} of the oscillator, which is equal to the vector norm:
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_d = \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{\Omega^2_n - \qty(\tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_p)^2}.
\end{equation}

Instead of the Cartesian coordinates for the normalized vector part used in \cref{eq:ddho_vector}, we will adopt a more parsimonious description in the form of the so-called \emph{pseudospherical coordinates}. These consist of a \emph{hyperbolic angle} \(\tau\)  and a Euclidean angle \(\sigma\), which specify a point on either one of the sheets of the two-sheet hyperboloid shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloids}. The pseudospherical coordinates are related to the Cartesian coordinates through the following relations:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{a}_1 = \pm\cosh(\tau) \qquad \hat{a}_2 = \sinh(\tau) \cos(\sigma) \qquad \hat{a}_3 = \sinh(\tau) \sin(\sigma).
\end{equation}
In addition, we have:
\begin{equation} 
    \begin{array}{cc}
        \displaystyle \cosh(\tau) = \hat{a}_1, \quad & \quad 
        \displaystyle \sinh(\tau) = \sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}, \\[0.5cm]
        \displaystyle \cos(\sigma) = \frac{\hat{a}_2}{\sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}}, \qquad & \quad
        \displaystyle \sin(\sigma) = \frac{\hat{a}_3}{\sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}}. 
    \end{array}
    \label{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}
\end{equation}

The geometry of an elliptic trajectory is determined by its \emph{aspect ratio} and its \emph{tilt angle}, as shown in \cref{fig:ellipse}. For the aspect ratio many measures exist, of which the \emph{eccentricity} \(e\) is the best known. Other measures of eccentricity are listed in \cref{tab:ellipse}; especially the third flattening and third eccentricity play an important role in the remainder of the discussion.

    \input{media/tikz/ellipse}
    \caption{Geometric parameters of the ellipse. Its shape is characterized by two lengths: the semi-major axis \(r_+\) and the semi-minor axis \(r_-\). The various measures of the aspect ratio of the ellipse given in \cref{tab:ellipse} express the relative size of \(r_+\) with respect to \(r_-\) in various ways. The (first) eccentricity \(e\) parameter locates the focal points \(F_1, F_2\) as a proportion of the semi-major axis. The angle \(\theta\) by which the semi-major axis is rotated with respect to the horizontal is called the \emph{tilt}.}

To relate the normalized vector part (in pseudospherical coordinates) to the geometric features of the elliptic integral curves, the solution trajectories of the basis vector fields given by \cref{tab:basis_vf} can be weighted by the vector components to obtain the overall implicit form of the elliptic trajectories.

For \(X_\quati\), the solution curves have the implicit form 
\begin{equation}
    \tfrac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) = \text{cst},
\end{equation}
i.e. they are concentric circles of some radius. Second, for \(X_\quatj\), we have the implicit form
\begin{equation}
    \tfrac{1}{2}(p^2 - q^2) = \text{cst}.
\end{equation}
Thirdly, for \(X_\quatk\), the solution trajectories are of the form
\begin{equation}
    pq = \text{cst}.
\end{equation}

From the above expression we can find the shape of the actual solution trajectory by weighing each of these curves with the respective components of the normalized vector part:
\begin{equation}
    \underbrace{(\hat{a}_1 - \hat{a}_2)}_{\coloneq R} q^2 + \underbrace{2 \hat{a}_3}_{\coloneq S} pq + \underbrace{(\hat{a}_1 + \hat{a}_2)}_{\coloneq T} p^2 = \text{cst}.
    \label{eq:ellipse_equation}
\end{equation}
The actual radius of the trajectory is immaterial for the discussion, for it depends on the initial condition chosen for the system and does not influence the shape of the ellipse. 
The above expression is the implicit equation for an ellipse if \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    S^2 - 4RT < 0.
\end{equation}
Substitution shows that this condition is equivalent to \(\vec{a}\) being timelike. 

\subsubsection{Eccentricity} The eccentricity of the ellipse specified by \cref{eq:ellipse_equation} in terms of the parameters \(R, S\) and  \(T\) is equal to \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}{(R + T) + \sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}}.
    \label{eq:eccentricity}
\end{equation}
Since we have that \(R - T = -2\hat{a}_2\), \(R + T = 2\hat{a}_1\) and \(S = 2\hat{a}_3\), the eccentricity may be expressed as a function of the components of the split-quaternion too:
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}}{q_1 + \sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}}}.
\end{equation}
Finally, using the relations stated in \cref{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}, this expression can be succinctly written in terms of the pseudospherical coordinates $\tau$ and $\sigma$:
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sinh(\tau)}{\cosh(\tau) + \sinh(\tau)}}. 
    \label{eq:e_pseudosphere_coords}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Tilt angle} The tilt angle \(\theta\) of the ellipse is defined as the angle between the positive horizontal \(q\)-axis and the major axis of the ellipse. Just like the eccentricity, we start from the general expression in terms of the parameters \(R, T\) and \(S\):
\begin{equation}
    \tan(\theta) = \frac{T - R - \sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}{S}.
\end{equation}
Again, substituting the split-quaternion components, we have
\begin{equation}
    \tan(\theta) = \frac{\hat{a}_2 - \sqrt{\hat{a}_2^2 + \hat{a}_3^2}}{\hat{a}_3}.
    \label{eq:tilt_angle}
\end{equation}
Rather unsurprisingly, the \(\quati\)-component does not play a role in the tilt angle of the trajectory: from \cref{fig:basis_vf}, we can see that the associated vector field \(X_\quati\) is indeed rotationally symmetric, in contrast to \(X_\quatj\) or \(X_\quatk\).

\Cref{eq:tilt_angle} may be expressed in terms of the pseudospherical coordinates (cf. \cref{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}) as wel:
\begin{equation}
     \tan(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\sigma) - 1}{\sin(\sigma)} = -\tan(\frac{\sigma}{2}).
\end{equation}

Hence, we infer that the \emph{tilt angle is equal to half the pseudospherical angle, oppositely oriented}:
\begin{equation}
     \theta = -\frac{\sigma}{2}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Orientation} 
The two-sheet hyperboloid consists of two disconnected surfaces. This begs the question what the significance is of either of those surfaces. The hyperboloids are directed along the \(\quati\)-axis; therefore, the sign of the \(\quati\)-component of \(\vec{a}\) determines on which hyperboloid the vector is located. Physically, the sign of the \(\quati\)-component determines whether the rotational part of the vector field has a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. By default, \(X_\quati\) is an infinitesimal clockwise rotation (cf. \cref{fig:basis_vf}): as a result, if \(a_0\) is positive the rotation is clockwise and vice versa.

The obtained relations show that the pseudospherical coordinates \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) are directly related to respectively the tilt angle and the eccentricity of the elliptic trajectories. We will now investigate the role of these coordinates in two common projections of the two-sheet hyperboloid, being the \emph{Poincaré model} and the \emph{Cayley-Klein model}. As it turns out, the coordinates in these projections correspond with the eccentricity parameters defined \cref{tab:ellipse}.

\subsubsection{Relation with models of the hyperbolic plane}
The \emph{hyperbolic plane} is a plane that has everywhere a constant negative Gaussian curvature. The geometry of the hyperbolic plane is known as \emph{hyperbolic geometry}, as opposed to \emph{Euclidean geometry} and \emph{spherical geometry}, which are associated with surfaces of no curvature and constant positive curvature respectively. 

In contrast to the Euclidean plane and the sphere (which exhibits spherical geometry), the hyperbolic plane cannot be isometrically embedded in three-dimensional space; this is formalized in Hilbert's theorem on differential geometry \cite{Thurston1997}. This is why mathematicians must resort to so-called \emph{models} of the hyperbolic plane. Many are in existence, for example the hyperboloid model, the Poincaré disk, the Cayley-Klein disk, and the Poincaré half-plane. The former three will be of our interest in this context. For more information concerning hyperbolic geometry, the reader is referred to \citet{Needham1997,Needham2021} and \citet{Thurston1997}.

\paragraph{Hyperboloid model} The \emph{hyperboloid model} consists simply of the positive sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid, embedded in the Lorentzian 3-space. In this space, this sheet of the hyperboloid has a constant negative Gaussian curvature equal to -1 \cite{Balazs1986}. Because of this constant negative curvature, the positive sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid can serve as a model for the hyperbolic plane.

Both the Poincaré disk and the Cayley-Klein disk arise by projecting the hyperboloid surface to a disk with unit radius in a particular fashion. In the \(\quati\)-\(\quatj\)-plane, these projections are illustrated in \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/hyperboloid_projection}
    \caption{Illustration of the projection on the Poincaré disk and the Cayley-Klein disk. The Lorentzian 3-space is intersected along the $\quati$-$\quatj$-plane; both disks therefore appear as a line segment with `radius' 1.}
    \label{fig:hyperboloid_projection}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Cayley-Klein disk} The Cayley-Klein is the result of \emph{gnomonic projection} of the positive hyperboloid sheet \cite{Benedetti1992}. The advantage of gnomonic projection is that geodesics on the hyperboloid map to straight lines in the disk. On the downside, this projection method is not conformal (it does not preserve angles). As shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection} and \cref{fig:cayley_disk}, the projection of a point on the hyperboloid is the intersection of the line segment of that point with the origin and the disk with unit radius, centered at the point \(\quati\) (i.e. the point in Lorentzian 3-space with coordinates \((1, 0, 0)\)). 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{media/other/cayley_disk-eps-converted-to}
    \caption{The Cayley-Klein disk and the hyperboloid model are related through gnomonic projection. A geodesic of on the hyperboloid model is shown as well, its projected image in the Cayley-Klein disk (also a geodesic) is a straight line. Illustration adapted from \citet{Balazs1986}.}
    \label{fig:cayley_disk}
\end{figure}

If polar coordinates are used to specify a point in the Cayley-Klein disk, the rotation angle \(\sigma\) remains identical to the corresponding pseudospherical coordinate, and from \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection} it can readily be deduced that the radial coordinate \(r_\text{k} \in \interval[open right]{0}{1}\) is simply equal to
\begin{equation}
    r_\text{k} = \tanh(\tau).
\end{equation}
We can now use \cref{eq:e_pseudosphere_coords} to relate the radial coordinate to the eccentricity of the elliptic trajectory (the angular coordinate remains again identical):
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sinh(\tau)}{\cosh(\tau) + \sinh(\tau)}} = \sqrt{\frac{2r_\text{k}}{1 + r_\text{k}}}. 
\end{equation}
This expression shows that the \emph{radius in the Cayley-Klein disk is equal to the square of the third eccentricity of the elliptic trajectory} \(e''\), also denoted by `\(m\)' in literature (we will not do so here, for it is already reserved for mass). In terms of the major and minor axes (\(r_+\) and \(r_-\) respectively), we thus have: \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    r_\text{p} = \frac{r_+^2 - r_-^2}{r_+^2 + r_-^2} = \qty(e'')^2.
    \label{eq:eccentricity_cayley}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{The Poincaré disk} The \emph{Poincaré disk} is the image of the positive hyperboloid sheet under \emph{stereographic projection} with respect to the point \(-\quati\), i.e. the point in Lorentzian 3-space with coordinates \((-1, 0, 0)\). That is to say, the projection of a point on the hyperboloid on the Poincaré disk is equal to the intersection of the line segment connecting that point with \(-\quati\) and the unit disk centered at the origin. This is illustrated in \cref{fig:poincare_disk,fig:hyperboloid_projection}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{media/other/poincare_disk-eps-converted-to}
    \caption{The Poincaré disk and the hyperboloid model are related through stereographic projection. A geodesic of on the hyperboloid model is shown as well, its projected image in the Poincaré disk (also a geodesic) is part of a circle that intersects the boundary of the disk at right angles. Illustration adapted from \citet{Balazs1986}.}
    \label{fig:poincare_disk}
\end{figure}

If polar coordinates are used in the Poincaré disk, then the Euclidean rotation remains identical, and the radial coordinate is equal to
\begin{equation} 
    r_\text{pc} = \tanh(\frac{\tau}{2}) = \frac{\sinh(\tau)}{1 + \cosh(\tau)}. 
\end{equation}
Because stereographic projection projects each point on the positive hyperboloid uniquely onto the Poincaré disk, every point on the disk corresponds to two possible elliptic trajectories: one with clockwise and one with counterclockwise rotation.

As stated by \cref{eq:eccentricity_cayley}, the Cayley-Klein radius is equal to the square of the third eccentricity. Along the same line, the radius in the Poincaré disk may be related to a specific measure of elliptic eccentricity as well. Using the double angle formula for \( \tanh \), we have that
\begin{equation}
     r_\text{k} = \frac{2r_\text{pc}}{1 + r_\text{pc}^2}.
\end{equation}
Hence, we gather that the \emph{Poincaré radius is equal to the third flattening of the elliptic trajectory}, commonly denoted by \(n\) or \(f''\). In terms of the major and minor axes of the elliptic trajectory, the Poincaré radius is equal to
\begin{equation}
     r_\text{pc} = \frac{r_+ - r_-}{r_+ + r_-} = f''.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Relation with eigenvectors} 
As mentioned, the normalized vector part \(\uvec{a}\) encodes the same information as the eigenvectors of the associated matrix \(A\). For an underdamped system, both the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the matrix are complex. These complex eigenvectors are not directly interpretable; they can be multiplied by any complex number to obtain another eigenvector of the system. In one particular instance (i.e. a specific length in \(\complex^2\)), the real and imaginary part of the eigenvectors align with the major and minor axes (\(r^+, r^-\)) of the elliptic trajectory, but this requires additional computation to find the correct multiplication factor for the eigenvectors \cite{Edwards2018}. 

Conversely, as demonstrated in the above discussion, the normalized split-quaternions are naturally parameterized in way that corresponds directly to the shape parameters of the solution trajectories. As vectors in the phase plane, the semi-major and semi-minor axes can be expressed in terms of \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) as follows (where the semi-major axis has length 1):
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \vec{r}^+ &= \mqty(\cos(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) & \sin(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) \\ -\sin(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) & \cos(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}))\mqty(1 \\ 0 ) \\
        \vec{r}^- &= \mqty(\cos(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) & \sin(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) \\ -\sin(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}) & \cos(\tfrac{\sigma}{2}))\mqty( 0 \\ \frac{1 - \tanh(\tfrac{\tau}{2})}{1 + \tanh(\tfrac{\tau}{2})}), \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:major_axes}
\end{equation}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
since \(\displaystyle \frac{r^-}{r^+} = \frac{1 - f''}{1 + f''}\).

\subsubsection{The Lorentzian cross-product}
Finally, we relate the action of the conservative part of the state matrix on the phase plane to the action of vector part $\vec{a}$ of the associated split-quaternion through the Lorentzian cross-product, defined in \cref{eq:lorcross}. 

First, we define the notion of \emph{Lorentz orthogonality} based on the Lorentzian inner product (cf. \cref{eq:lorinner}): two vectors are Lorentz-orthogonal if their Lorentzian inner product is equal to zero. In an analogous fashion to the conventional cross product, the Lorentz cross product of two vectors is Lorentz orthogonal to both of those vectors.

Given that \(\vec{a}\) is the vector part of the split-quaternion representation of the state-transition matrix \(A\), we wish to relate the vector field generated by \(A\) to the vector field generated by \(\vec{a}\) as `operator': \(\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}(\vec{b}) \coloneq \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}\). The operator \(\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}\) has an invariant linear subspace: the plane that is Lorentz-orthogonal to the vector \(\vec{a}\). This is visualized in \cref{fig:cross_product}. Expressing \(\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}\) as a matrix, we get:
\begin{equation}
    [\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}](\vec{b}) = \mqty(0 & a_3 & -a_2 \\ a_3 & 0 & -a_1 \\ -a_2 & a_1 & 0) \mqty(b_1\\b_2\\b_3).
\end{equation}

The eigenvalues of \( [\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}] \)  are \(\qty{0, \pm \ii\sqrt{a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2}}\), i.e. the imaginary part of the eigenvalues is the same as the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of \(A\) (or the eigenvalues of \(A\) with trace removed), with the addition of zero. The zero direction is colinear with the vector \(\vec{a}\).  This means that in the Lorentz orthogonal plane, the action of \( [\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}] \) is the same as the action of \(A - \frac{\tr(A)}{2}I\) (the associated matrix with trace removed) on the phase plane, \emph{given the right basis}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{media/other/cross_product.pdf}
    \caption{Vector field generated by the Lorentzian cross product by \(\vec{a}\) on the vectors in the plane that is Lorentz-orthogonal to \(\vec{a}\). The vectors $\vec{s}_+$ and $\vec{s}_-$ are the principal axes of (one of the) elliptic trajectories. The positive sheet of the hyperboloid is shown as well.}
    \label{fig:cross_product}
\end{figure}

We can find the correct basis by relating the major axes of the elliptic trajectory generated by \( [\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}] \), denoted by \((\vec{s}_+, \vec{s}_-)\) (also shown in \cref{fig:cross_product})
to the major axes of the elliptic trajectory \((\vec{r}_+, \vec{r}_-)\) given by \cref{eq:major_axes}. 

The semi-major axis \(\vec{s}_+\) of the elliptic trajectory generated by the Lorentzian cross-product can be obtained by projecting the vector \(\vec{a}\) on the plane that is Lorentz orthogonal to it. The semi-minor axis is simply found by applying the Lorentzian cross-product to the semi-major axis. That is,
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \vec{s}_+ &= \vec{a} - \frac{ \inner{\vec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \uvec{n}, \\
        \vec{s}_- &= \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\vec{s}_+}, \\
    \end{split}
    \label{eq:crossp_basis_vectors}
\end{equation}
where \(\uvec{n} = a_1\quati - a_2\quatj - a_3\quatk\) is the normal vector to the plane that is Lorentz-orthogonal to \(\vec{a}\). Please note that we are using two types of orthogonality: both Lorentz and Euclidean. The inner product \(\inner{\,}{}\) refers to the Euclidean inner product, as opposed to the Lorentzian inner product. We will now prove that $\vec{s}_+$ and $\vec{s}_-$ as given above indeed are the principal axes of the elliptic trajectory generated by the Lorentzian cross product.

\begin{proof}
    For convenience, we will use the normalized vector $\uvec{a}$ in place of $\vec{a}$ without loss of generality. 
    A unit normal vector to the Lorentz-orthogonal subspace is 
    \[\uvec{n} = \hat{a}_1\quati - \hat{a}_2\quatj - \hat{a}_3\quatk.\] 
    Following \cref{eq:crossp_basis_vectors}, the basis vectors are
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \vec{s}_+ &= \uvec{a} - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \uvec{n} \\
            \vec{s}_- &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\vec{s}_+} = -\frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}}),
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    because the Lorentz-cross product distributes over addition and \(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{a}} = \mathbf{0}\). 

    If \((\vec{s}_+, \vec{s}_-)\) are the major axes of the elliptic trajectory generated by the cross product, then they must be the real and imaginary part of an eigenvector of \([\uvec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}]\). Hence, it must be the case that 
    \begin{equation}
        [\uvec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}](\vec{s}_+ + \vec{s}_-\ii) = \lambda(\vec{s}_+ + \ii\vec{s}_-),
\end{equation} 
    where \(\lambda\) is then an eigenvalue of the matrix \cite{Edwards2018}. This can be verified by replacing the action of \([\uvec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}]\) with the cross product. 
    
    Plugging in the definition and exploiting the linearity of the Lorentz cross-product, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\qty(\vec{s}_+ + \ii\vec{s}_-)} 
            &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\vec{s}_+} +
        \ii\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\vec{s}_-}) \\
            &= \vec{s}_- + \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\vec{s}_-})\ii \\ 
            &=\vec{s}_- +  \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\vec{s}_+})})\ii \\
            &=\vec{s}_- -  \frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}}}{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}})})\ii.  \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The triple cross-product expansion, or \emph{Lagrange formula}, relates the regular cross product to the corresponding dot product:
    \begin{equation}
     \vec{x}\times\qty(\vec{y}\times\vec{z}) = \vec{y}\:\inner{\vec{z}}{\vec{x}} - \vec{z}\:\inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}.
    \end{equation}
    This well-known identity generalizes (easily verified) to the Lorentzian counterpart of the cross- and inner product:
    \begin{equation}
         \lorcrossp{\vec{x}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\vec{y}}{\vec{z}})} 
       = \vec{y}\:\lorinner{\vec{z}}{\vec{x}} - \vec{z}\:\lorinner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}.
    \end{equation}
    Using the Lagrange formula, the above expression becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \lorcrossp{\uvec{a}}{\qty(\vec{s}_+ + \ii\vec{s}_-)} &= 
                \vec{s}_- - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\uvec{a}\,\lorinner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} - \uvec{n}\lorinner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{a}})\ii \\
                & =\, \vec{s}_- - \qty(\uvec{a}\,\frac{ \lorinner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} \, \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
                & =\, \vec{s}_- - \qty(\uvec{a} - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{a}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
                & =\, \vec{s}_- - \vec{s}_+\ii. \\
                & =\, -\ii(\vec{s}_+ + \ii\vec{s}_-). 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The latter is the scalar multiple of the vector \(\vec{s}_+ + \vec{s}_-\) by \(-\ii\) - hence, this is indeed an eigenvector of the corresponding matrix. This means that indeed, \(\vec{s}_+ + \vec{s}_-\) are the principal axes of the elliptic trajectoy generated by the Lorentzian cross-product.
\end{proof}

Knowing the eigenvectors of both matrices, the state matrix \(A\) and matrix generated by the Lorentzian cross-product \([\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}]\) can be related through the following similarity transformation:
\begin{equation}
     A = T^{-1}\,[\vec{a}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}]\,T,
\end{equation}
where the transformation matrix is constructed from the principal axes in both the phase plane and the Lorentz orthogonal plane:
\begin{equation}
     T = \mqty(\vec{r}_+ & \vec{r}_-) \mqty(\vec{s}_+ & \vec{s}_-)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
