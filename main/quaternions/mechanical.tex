\section{Application to mechanical systems}
\label{sec:mechanical}
We will now proceed by using a mechanical `prototype' example instead of the generic dynamical system of the preceding section. This mechanical system is the harmonic oscillator with two dampers: one in series and one in parallel, as already discussed in \cref{ssec:serial_damping}. The reason for this is twofold: first, it helps to establish the connction between this chapter and \cref{chap:geometric_structures}, and secondly, it allows us to gain a physical intuition behind the split-quaternion representation. 

In particular, the oscillator with two dampers is chosen because the corresponding state transition matrix the extra damper `fills' the one entry that would otherwise remain zero in the state transition matrix in case of the conventional damped harmonic oscillator. Therefore, this system can represent (in theory) all the possible two-dimensional systems discussed in the previous section.

\subsection{Equations of motion}
The harmonic oscillator with two dampers is shown in \cref{fig:double_damped_osc}, and its equations of motion are given by \cref{eq:serial_eom_raw}. In matrix form, the equations of motion are:
\begin{equation*}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \mqty(-\tfrac{k}{b_s} & \tfrac{1}{m} \\ -k & - \tfrac{b_p}{m})\mqty(q \\ p).
\end{equation*}
Alternatively, using the $\gamma_p = b_p/m$, $\gamma_s = k/b_s$, and $\Omega_n = \sqrt{k/m}$, we have the following:
\begin{equation}
    \mqty(\dot{q}\\\dot{p}) = \underbrace{\mqty(-\gamma_s & \frac{1}{m} \\ -m\Omega_n^2 & - \gamma_p)}_A \mqty(q \\ p).
    \label{eq:ddho_eom}
\end{equation}

The split-quaternion associated with the $A$-matrix of the doubly damped system can easily be found using the mapping defined by \cref{eq:inv_quat_isom}. We must, however, be careful when dealing with physical systems, because the entries of the $A$-matrix are not dimensionless. In a vector space, we associate the units with the basis vectors, not with the components. For example, in a two-dimensional vector space spanned by a axis for apples and and an axis for pears, and we wish to represent that someone possesses three apples and four pairs, the \emph{components} of that vector are $(3, 4)$, and the \emph{unit vectors} are $(1 \text{ apple}, 1\text{ pear})$. Along the same line, we must define the units in the $A$-matrix in the split-quaternion basis elements 1, \quati, \quatj, \quatk. To do so, we define the reference quantities and $m_0, t_0$. The basis elements are then mapped in terms of these reference quantities:
$$ 
    \phi(1) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & \tfrac{1}{t_0}), \quad 
    \phi(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  -\tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \quad
    \phi(\quati) = \mqty(0 & \tfrac{1}{m_0} \\  \tfrac{m_0}{t_0^2} & 0), \quad
    \phi(\quatk) = \mqty(\tfrac{1}{t_0} & 0 \\ 0 & -\tfrac{1}{t_0}), \quad 
$$
where, in case we would use SI units, $m_0 = \SI{1}{\kilogram}$ and $t_0 = \SI{1}{\second}$. As a result, the split-quaternion associated with the $A$-matrix given in \cref{eq:ddho_eom} becomes
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_s + t_0\gamma_p)\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quati\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(\frac{m_0}{m} + \frac{m\Omega_n^2 t_0^2}{m_0})\quatj\:+\:\frac{1}{2}\qty(t_0\gamma_p - t_0\gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat_units}
\end{equation}

Clearly, all the components of the split-quaternion are dimensionless. This really is not too wild of an idea: after all, we are translating the matrix itself, and \emph{not} the two-dimensional vector space that it acts on. The units are inherited from the vector space, so we should only add them when returning from the split-quaterions back to the realm of the matrices. 

The preceding argument only explains why we can work around this issue without performing illegal operations, but it does not give a satisfactory answer as to why we would be interested to add numbers that are seemingly incompatible. Indeed, observe that $\gamma_s$ and $\gamma_p$ have the same units, whereas $\tfrac{1}{m}$ and $\Omega_n^2$ do not. So, in which sense can the $\quati$ and $\quatj$-components be of any signficance? To answer this question, we first note that `rescaling of units' is a linear operation on the vector space given by a diagonal matrix (with nonzero diagonal entries): 
$$ N = \mqty(\dmat[0]{\nu_1}{\nu_2}) \qquad \nu_1, \nu_2 \in \real^*, $$
which form the group isomorphic to $(\real^*)^2$. This transformation of the vector space manifests itself on the $A$-matrix as: $ A' = N^{-1}A N$. It is easy to see that the basis matrices (or vector fields) for `1' and \quatk are invariant under this transformation, while the \quati and \quatj-matrices are not (that is, without making use of the reference quantities). 

A geometric explanation is that the eigenvectors of the identity matrix and the \quatk-matrix point along the axes; and are therefore invariant under rescaling of these axes. As a result of this fact, the \quati and \quatj components will not transform properly under a unit transformation. It is common practice in physics to rescale the state space of the undamped harmonic oscillator as follows \cite{Dekker1981,Dedene1980}
$$ p \mapsto \frac{p}{m} \qquad q \mapsto m\Omega q, $$
such that the Hamiltonian reverts to a particularly convenient form. We can see that this is precisely the transformation that kills the \quatj-component of the split-quaternion. This would essentially resolve this `unit problem', because it only arises when we attempt to make the \emph{distinction} between the \quati and \quatj-component.

In contrast the common practice of rescaling the units, we are interested in the full range of geometrical properties that the trajectories in the phase plane can exhibit, including those that are not invariant under the action of the structure group $(\real^*)^2$. Furthermore, many invariants, such as the split-quaternion (vector) norm, scalar part, etc. that we use to draw conclusions about the nature of the system \emph{do} commute with this group action, and are therefore remain valid. It is even possible to effect unit transformations within the split-quaternion transformations by translating the matrix $N$ to the appropriate split-quaternion using the isomorphism. We can indeed observe that the action of $n^{-1} a n$ (where $n = \phi^{-1}(N)$) produces a split-quaternion with zero $\quatj$-component. 

As a final argument, we can say that the `rescaling of the axes', while common in physics and mathematically allowed, is of little use for engineers, since they tend to stick to SI units in the first place. The `scale of the axes' is therefore a physical reality. This is why we choose not to discard the $\quatj$-component through a rescaling.

To conclude, it is not so much the case that unit transformations are not allowed in the split-quaternion space, but the question as to what the units of the \quatj-components are is moot. Unfortunately, the notation in \cref{eq:ddho_quat_units} is rather obfuscating. Hence, we take the freedom to choose $m_0 = 1 (\si{\kilogram})$ and $t_0 = 1 (\si{\second})$, and write the split-quaternion as follows:
\begin{equation}
    a\:=\: -\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_s + \gamma_p)\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2)\quati\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2)\quatj\:+\:\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_p - \gamma_s)\quatk. 
    \label{eq:ddho_quat}
\end{equation}
Leaving out the reference quantities requires the silent understanding that all the components are dimensionless, and that we are not just adding apples and pears. 

In the next section, we investigate the influence that of each of the split-quaternion components has on the physical behavior of the mechanical system.

\subsection{The physical significance of the split-quaternion representation}
As mentioned previously, the qualitative regime of the dynamical system can be deduced from the sign of its split-quaternion and vector norm. In the particular case of the harmonic oscillator with two dampers, we assume that the damping coefficients $\gamma_s, \gamma_p$ are either positive or zero and that mass $m$ and the spring constant $k$ are both strictly positive. The norm of the split-quaternion given in \cref{eq:ddho_quat} is
$$ \mathscr{N}(a) = m \Omega_n^2 + \gamma_p \gamma_s.$$
From this expression we find that, given the assumptions, the norm of $a$ is always positive, and that we are therefore always dealing with a timelike split-quaternion. 

\subsubsection{Real part of the split-quaternion} 
The real part of the split-quaternion representation of the harmonic oscillator with two dampers is (cf. \cref{eq:ddho_quat}),
$$ a_0 = -\tfrac{1}{2}(\gamma_s + \gamma_p). $$
This real part therefore to the combined effect represents the combined effect of both the dampers.

%The real part of the split-quaternion representation of a matrix $A$ coincides with the real part of the eigenvalues $A$. 
As can be observed from \cref{eq:system_solution} and \cref{fig:basis_vf}, the real part $a_0$ appears in the system solution as part of the argument of the exponential that envelopes the inner part of the solution, but it does not influence it in any other fashion. This is a consequence of the fact that the vector fields proportional to $X_1$ commute with all the other vector fields, as discussed in \cref{ssec:vf_algebra}. 

In the context of the mechanical system, this `commuting of vector fields' means that the overall transformation of the state-space that is generated by the vector field can be seen as the composition of two separate transformations. The first is a purely exponential contraction of the phase space (assuming $\gamma_s, \gamma_p > 0$), which is the overall effect of the dampers. Secondly, we have the remaining transformation that is generated by the combined effect of the vector part $\vec{a}$. The latter cannot be decomposed into separate $\quati$, $\quatj$ and $\quatk$ \emph{transformations}, because the vector fields that generate them do not commute.

Because the transformations generated by the vector part of $a$ are conservative (in contrast to the exponential contraction), this decomposition of the transformations is the amounts to separating the dissipative and conservative effects in present in the mechanical system. That is to say, we decompose the system solution into two parts:
$$ \exp(a t) = \underbrace{\exp(a_0 t)}_{\text{\tiny dissipative}} \: \underbrace{\exp(\vec{a} t)}_{\text{\tiny conservative}}. $$

From the above expression, it can be seen that the dissipative component of the solution is rather simple: it is simply a contraction by $\ec^{a_0t } = \ec^{-(\gamma_s + \gamma_p)t}$. This is why we will now focus exclusively on the nature of the second transformation, being the conservative part. From the split-quaternion point of view, this means that we assume that the real part vanishes, and only take the vector part into account.

\subsubsection{Vector part of the split-quaternion} 
The vector part of $a$ has three components. Based on the associated basis vector fields shown in \cref{fig:basis_vf} and \cref{eq:ddho_quat}, the following observations can be made
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \quati-component of the split-quaternion gives rise to a rotational vector field that is rotationally symmetric, since the solution trajectories are concentric circles. A positive component gives rise to a clockwise rotation. For the mechanical system, this component is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2)$; it induces the \emph{oscillatory} or \emph{periodic motion} of the harmonic oscillator.
    \item The \quatj-component of the split-quaternion is a hyperbolic (saddle) vector field, its solution trajectories are hyperbolae whose asymptotes are the diagonals of the phase plane. For the mechanical system, this component is equal to $\tfrac{1}{2}\qty(\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2)$: it measures the imbalance between the two terms that constitute the rotation. As a result, the combination of the $\quati$ and $\quatj$-components is an ellipse that is stretched or squeezed along its primary axes, but \emph{not} rotated. The undamped harmonic oscillator is of this type.
    \item Finally, the \quatk-component is also a hyperbolic (saddle) vector field whose asymptotes are the horizontal and vertical axis. For the mechanical system, the $\quatk$-component is equal to the \emph{imbalance between the two dampers}, i.e. $\frac{1}{2}\qty(\gamma_p - \gamma_s)$. It also gives rise to a stretch and squeeze of the trajectory, but now along the diagonals of the phase plane. Therefore, it results in a \emph{phase shift} or `wobble' in the trajectory.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Vector norm}
[Now go on with vector norm]
discuss regime and damping ratio

For the mechanical system, the vector norm is equal to 
$$ \mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = m\Omega^2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_p + \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s \gamma_p. $$
The vector norm is equal the square of the `imaginary part' of the eigenvalues of $A$. In the context of the damped harmonic oscillator, this imaginary part is often referred to as the \emph{damped frequency} $\Omega_d$. 

As mentioned in \cref{sec:system_classification}, the sign of the vector norm determines the regime of the mechanical system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) > 0$ (timelike vector), the system is underdamped (or undamped); 
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) = 0$ (lightlike vector), the system is critically damped; 
    \item if $\mathscr{N}(\vec{a}) < 0$ (spacelike vector), the system is overdamped.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{The Lorentzian 3-space}

\paragraph{The normalized vector norm}
We now wish to dissect the structure of the two-dimensional system even further by removing influence the vector norm as well, looking at the \emph{normalized} vector part. Since this removes precisely the information contained in the eigenvalues of the system, we expect to end up with the split-quaternion equivalent of the \emph{eigenvectors} of the associated matrix $A$. The real part of the split-quaternion, or the trace of the matrix, does not influence the eigenvectors of the matrix either. This can be observed from the following expression
$$ (A - \lambda I)\vec{v} = \qty[(A + s I) - ((s + \lambda) I) \gamma I)]\vec{v}, $$
i.e. adding any scalar multiple of the identity to the matrix adds this scalar to the value of all the eigenvalues, and leaves the eigenvectors unaltered.

The following diagram provides a summary of the structure of the split-quaternion representation, and how the different components manifest themselves in the behavior of the system. The assumptions is made that we are dealing either with a spacelike or timelike vector, and that therefore the normalized vector part is well-defined.

    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Normalized vector in the Lorentzian space} Since two degrees of freedom have been removed from what was originally a four-dimensional, the normalized vector part lives in a two-dimensional space. Embedded in the Lorentz space, the normalized vector parts are lie in a collection of disconnected surfaces, depending on their regime:
\begin{itemize}
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is timelike, the unit vectors live on the \emph{two-sheet unit hyperboloid}:
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 1};$$
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is lightlike, the vectors live on the \emph{light cone} (normalizing these vector is not possible):
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 0}; $$
    \item if $\vec{a}$ is spacelike, the vectors live on the \emph{one-sheet unit hyperboloid}:
        $$ \qty{\vec{a} \in \real^3 \mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = -1}. $$
\end{itemize}
These three surfaces (two-sheet hyperboloid, one-sheet hyperboloid and the light cone) are shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloids}. 

Since the regime of the mechanical system is determined by its vector norm, we can locate underdamped systems on the two-sheet hyperboloid, overdamped systems on the one-sheet hyperboloid and critically damped systems on the light cone. These surfaces are aligned along the $\quati$-axis.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{media/other/lorentz_space.png}
    \caption{The disconnected `unit sphere' in the Lorentzian 3-space. The blue surface is the one-sheet hyperboloid, containing all the spacelike unit vectors representing overdamped mechanical systems. The gray sheet is the light cone, that contains all the lightlike `null' vectors with zero norm, representing critically damped systems. Finally, the red surfaces constitute the two-sheet hyperboloid, which is the space of all timelike unit vectors, representing underdamped (or undamped) systems.}
    \label{fig:hyperboloids}
\end{figure}

The eigenvalues represent a (composite) frequency of the system: they tell how fast the states evolve along the solution trajectories. The shape of the trajectories (given a certain regime) is encoded in the eigenvectors of the system. Hence, a certain point on each of the three surfaces shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloids} coincide with a trajectory shape, once the overall effect of damping is removed (real part), and disregarding the time parametrization along that trajectory (vector norm).

For the harmonic oscillator with two dampers, the unit vector is equal to:
$$ \uvec{a} \:= \:\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} + m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})\quati \: + \:\qty(\frac{\tfrac{1}{m} - m\Omega_n^2}{2\Omega_d})\quatj \:+ \:\qty(\frac{\gamma_p - \gamma_s}{2\Omega_d})\quatk,$$
with $\Omega_d$ being the damped frequency of the oscillator
$$ \Omega_d = \norm{\vec{a}} = \sqrt{m\Omega^2 - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_s - \tfrac{1}{4}\gamma_p + \tfrac{1}{2}\gamma_s \gamma_p} $$

We will now investigate the relation between the normalized vector part and the shape of the solution trajectories in each of the three cases (underdamped, critically damped and overdamped) in more detail.

\subsection{Underdamped systems}
For underdamped systems, the trajectories are spiral-shaped. Removing the real part from the split-quaternion is the same as removing the `contraction' in the spiral: as a result, the conservative version of this trajectory is an elliptic trajectory. This ellipse is subject to the same stretch and tilt of the original spiral, as illustrated by \cref{fig:underdamped}. 

The shape of the ellipse is completely determined by a measure of its eccentricity and a rotation angle (i.e. the angle between its major axis and the horizontal axis). The radius of the trajectory depends on the amount of energy present in the system and is therefore not a shape factor that is specific to the system.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/underdamped}
    \caption{Solution trajectories and vector field of an exemplary underdamped system. The red trajectories are the actual solution of the system, while the blue trajectories are the `convervative' version, i.e. with the real part of the split-quaternion removed.}
    \label{fig:underdamped}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Shape of the elliptic trajectory}
Every point on the two-sheet hyperboloid represents a specific elliptical trajectory with a certain rotation angle and eccentricity. Any point on the two-sheet unit hyperboloid is most conveniently expressed in \emph{pseudospherical coordinates}: a Euclidean rotation angle $\sigma$ around the $\quati$-axis and a hyperbolic angle $\tau$ \cite{Balazs1986}. In special relativity, the hyperbolic angle is typically called a \emph{boost}. For an arbitrary timelike unit vector part of a split-quaternion 
$$ \uvec{a} = \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quati + \frac{a_2}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quatj + \frac{a_3}{\norm{\vec{a}}}\quatk, $$
these angles are defined by the following relations:
$$ a_1 = \norm{\vec{a}}\cosh(\tau) \qquad a_2 = \norm{\vec{a}}\sinh(\tau) \cos(\sigma) \qquad a_3 = \norm{\vec{a}}\sinh(\tau) \sin(\sigma). $$
It is easily verified that the components indeed satisfy the relation
$$ \mathscr{N}(\uvec{a}) = a_1^2 - a_2^2 - a_3^2 = 1. $$
Furthermore, we have the following relations:
\begin{equation} 
    \begin{array}{cc}
        \displaystyle \cosh(\tau) = \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}, \quad & \quad 
        \displaystyle \sinh(\tau) = \frac{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}{\norm{\vec{a}}}, \\[0.5cm]
        \displaystyle \cos(\sigma) = \frac{a_2}{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}, \qquad & \quad
        \displaystyle \sin(\sigma) = \frac{a_3}{\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}. 
    \end{array}
    \label{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}
\end{equation}

We will now try to relate the location of the normalized vector part on the two-sheet hyperboloid to the geometric features of the elliptic solution trajectories. To do so, we can use the solution trajectories of the basis vector fields, and build the solution for the system based on the vector components. For the $X_\quati$, the solution curves have the implicit form 
$$ \tfrac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2) = C, $$
i.e. they are concentric circles of some radius. Secondly, for $X_\quatj$, we have the implicit form
$$ \tfrac{1}{2}(p^2 - q^2) = C.  $$
Thirdly, for $X_\quatk$, the solution trajectories are of the form
$$ pq = C. $$

From the above expression we can find the shape of the actual solution trajectory by weighing each of these curves with the respective components of the normalized vector part:
$$ \frac{a_1}{2\norm{\vec{a}}}\qty(q^2 + p^2)  + \frac{a_2}{2\norm{\vec{a}}}\qty(p^2 - q^2) + \frac{a_1}{\norm{\vec{a}}}pq = C. $$
Because we are not interested in the specific radius of the ellipse, we may multiply this expression by any nonzero factor. We have the following expression 
\begin{equation}
    \underbrace{(a_1 - a_2)}_{R} q^2 + \underbrace{2 a_3}_{S} pq + \underbrace{(a_1 + a_2)}_{T} p^2 = 2\norm{a}C,
    \label{eq:ellipse_equation}
\end{equation}
which is the implicit equation for an ellipse in case $S^2 - 4RT < 0$ \cite{Rapp1991}. Substitution shows that this condition is equivalent to $\vec{a}$ being timelike.

\paragraph{Eccentricity} The eccentricity of the ellipse described by \cref{eq:ellipse_equation} in terms of the parameters $R, S, T$ can be shown to be \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}{(R + T) + \sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}}.
    \label{eq:eccentricity}
\end{equation}
Since we have that $R - T = -2a_2$, $R + T = 2a_1$ and $S = 2a_3$, the eccentricity may be expressed as a function of the components of the split-quaternion as well:
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}{q_1 + \sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}}.
\end{equation}
Finally, using the relations stated in \cref{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}, this expression can be written in terms of the pseudospherical coordinates:
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sinh(\tau)}{\cosh(\tau) + \sinh(\tau)}}. 
    \label{eq:e_pseudosphere_coords}
\end{equation}
% Hence, we can observe that the eccentricity of the hyperbolic system trajectory is completely determined by the hyperbolic angle $\tau$, and not influenced by $\sigma$ at all.

\paragraph{Tilt angle} The tilt angle $\theta$ of the ellipse is defined as the angle between the positive horizontal ($q$)-axis and the major axis of the ellipse. Just like the eccentricity, we start from the general expression in terms of the parameters $R, T, S$:
\begin{equation}
    \tan(\theta) = \frac{T - R - \sqrt{(R - T)^2 + S^2}}{S}.
\end{equation}
Again, substituting the split-quaternion components, we have
\begin{equation}
    \tan(\theta) = \frac{a_2 - \sqrt{a_2^2 + a_3^2}}{a_3}.
    \label{eq:tilt_angle}
\end{equation}
Rather unsurprisingly, the $\quati$-component does not play a role in the tilt angle of the trajectory: from \cref{fig:basis_vf}, we can see that the associated vector field $X_\quati$ is indeed rotationally symmetric, in contrast to $X_\quatj$ or $X_\quatk$.

Again, \cref{eq:tilt_angle} may be expressed in terms of the pseudospherical coordinates (cf. \cref{eq:hyperb_coordinate_relations}):
$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\sigma) - 1}{\sin(\sigma)} = -\tan(\frac{\sigma}{2}).$$
Hence, we obtain that the angle 
$$\theta = -\frac{\sigma}{2}.$$

\paragraph{Orientation} Since the two-sheet hyperboloid consists of two disconnected surfaces, this begs the question what the significance is of either of those surfaces. The hyperboloids are directed along the $\quati$-axis. Therefore, sign of the $\quati$-component of $\vec{a}$ determines on which hyperboloid the vector is located. Physically, the sign of the $\quati$-component determines whether the `rotational' vector field has a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation. By default, $X_\quati$ is an infinitesimal clockwise rotation (cf. \cref{fig:basis_vf}): as a result, if $a_0$ is positive the rotation is clockwise and vice versa.

The obtained relations show that the pseudospherical coordinates $\sigma, \tau$ are directly related to the tilt angle and the eccentricity respectively of the elliptic trajectories. We will now investigate the role of these coordinates in two common projections of the two-sheet hyperboloid, being the \emph{Poincaré model} and the \emph{Cayley-Klein} model.

\subsubsection{Relation with models of the hyperbolic plane}
The positive sheet of the hyperboloid model embedded in the Lorentzian 3-space is commonly used as a model for the hyperbolic plane. The hyperbolic plane is a plane that has a constant negative Gaussian curvature everywhere. The hyperbolic plane exhibits what is called \emph{hyperbolic geometry}, which is the geometry associated with negative curvature, as opposed to \emph{Euclidean geometry} (no curvature) and \emph{spherical geometry} (positive curvature). 

In contrast to the Euclidean plane and the sphere (which exhibits spherical geometry), the hyperbolic plane cannot be isometrically embedded in three-dimensional space; this is formalized in Hilbert's theorem on differential geometry \cite{Thurston1997}. This is why mathematicians must resort to so-called \emph{models} of the hyperbolic plane. Many are in existence, for example the hyperboloid model, the Poincaré disk, the Cayley-Klein disk, and the Poincaré half-plane. The former three will be of our interest in this treatment. For more information concerning hyperbolic geometry, the reader is referred to \citet{Needham1997,Needham2021} and \citet{Thurston1997}.

\paragraph{Hyperboloid model} The \emph{hyperboloid model} consists simply of the positive sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid, embedded in the Lorentzian 3-space. In this space, this sheet of the hyperboloid has a constant negative Gaussian curvature equal to -1 \cite{Balazs1986}. Because of this constant negative curvature, the positive sheet of the two-sheet hyperboloid can serve as a model for the hyperbolic plane (it is a model because it is not embedded in Euclidean space). On the hyperboloid, geodesics are any line that arises by intersecting the hyperboloid with a plane through the origin.

Both the Poincaré disk and the Cayley-Klein disk arise by projecting the hyperboloid surface to a disk with unit radius in a prescribed fashion. In the $\quati$-$\quatj$-plane, these projections are illustrated in \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection}.

    \label{fig:hyperboloid_projection}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The Cayley-Klein disk} The Cayley-Klein is the result of \emph{gnomonic projection} of the positive hyperboloid sheet. The idea of gnomonic projection is that geodesics on the hyperboloid map to straight lines in the disk; on the downside, this projection method is not conformal (it does not preserve angles). As shown in \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection} and \cref{fig:cayley_disk}, the projection of a point on the hyperboloid is the intersection of the line segment of that point with the origin and the disk with unit radius, centered at the point $\quati$ (i.e. the point in Lorentzian 3-space with coordinates $(1, 0, 0)$).

    \label{fig:cayley_disk}
\end{figure}

If polar coordinates are used to specify a point in the Cayley-Klein disk, the rotation angle $\sigma$ remains identical to the corresponding pseudospherical coordinate, and from \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection} it can readily be deduced that the radial coordinate $r_\text{k} \in \interval[open right]{0}{1}$ is simply equal to
\begin{equation}
    r_\text{k} = \tanh(\tau).
\end{equation}
We can now use \cref{eq:e_pseudosphere_coords} to relate the radial coordinate to the eccentricity of the elliptic trajectory (of course, the significance of the angular coordinate remains identical):
\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{\frac{2\sinh(\tau)}{\cosh(\tau) + \sinh(\tau)}} = \sqrt{\frac{2r_\text{k}}{1 + r_\text{k}}}. 
\end{equation}
This expression shows that the radius in the Cayley-Klein disk is equal to the \emph{square of the third eccentricity} $e''$, also denoted by `$m$` in literature (we will not do so here, for it is already reserved for mass). In terms of the major and minor axes ($r_+$ and $r_-$ respectively), this we have: \cite{Rapp1991}
\begin{equation}
    r_\text{p} = \frac{r_+^2 - r_-^2}{r_+^2 + r_-^2} = \qty(e'')^2.
    \label{eq:eccentricity_cayley}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Poincaré disk} The \emph{Poincaré disk} is the image of the positive hyperboloid sheet under \emph{stereographic projection} with respect to the point $-\quati$, i.e. the point in Lorentzian 3-space with coordinates $(-1, 0, 0)$. That is to say, the projection of a point on the hyperboloid on the Poincaré disk is equal to the intersection of the line segment connecting that point with $-\quati$ and the unit disk centered at the origin. This is illustrated in \cref{fig:poincare_disk} and \cref{fig:hyperboloid_projection}. 
\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{media/other/poincare_disk-eps-converted-to}
    \caption{The Poincaré disk and the hyperboloid model are related through stereographic projection. A geodesic of on the hyperboloid model is shown as well, its projected image in the Poincaré disk (also a geodesic) is part of a circle that intersects the boundary of the disk at right angles. Illustration adapted from \citet{Balazs1986}.}
    \label{fig:poincare_disk}
\end{figure}

If polar coordinates are used in the Poincaré disk, then the Euclidean rotation remains identitical, and the radial coordinate is equal to
\begin{equation} 
    r_\text{pc} = \tanh(\frac{\tau}{2}) = \frac{\sinh(\tau)}{1 + \cosh(\tau)}. 
\end{equation}
Because stereographic projection projects each point on the positive hyperboloid uniquely onto the Poincaré disk, every point on the disk corresponds to two possible elliptic trajectories: one with clockwise and one with counterclockwise rotation.

As stated by \cref{eq:eccentricity_cayley}, the Cayley-Klein radius is equal to the square of the third eccentricity. Along the same line, the radius in the Poincaré disk may be related to a specific measure of elliptic eccentricity as well. Using the double angle formula for $ \tanh $, we have that
$$ r_\text{k} = = \frac{2r_\text{pc}}{1 + r_\text{pc}^2}. $$
Hence, we gather that the Poincaré radius is equal to the \emph{third flattening}, commonly denoted by $n$ or $f''$. In terms of the major and minor axes of the elliptic trajectory, the Poincaré radius is equal to
$$ r_\text{pc} = \frac{r_+ - r_-}{r_+ + r_-} = f''.$$

\paragraph{Eigenvectors of A} As mentioned, the normalized vector part $a$ encodes the same information as the eigenvectors of the associated matrix $A$. For an underdamped system, both the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the matrix are complex. These complex eigenvectors are not directly interpretable; they can be multiplied by any complex number to obtain another eigenvector of the system. In one particular instance (i.e. a specific length in $\complex^2$), the real and imaginary part of the eigenvectors align with the major and minor axes of the elliptic trajectory, but this requires additional computation to find the correct multiplication factor for the eigenvectors \cite{Edwards2018}. 

Conversely, as demonstrated in the above discussion, the normalized split-quaternions are naturally parameterized in way that corresponds directly to the shape parameters of the solution trajectories.

\subsection{The Lorentzian cross-product}
! orthogonal refers to `regular' orthogonal, Lorentz-orthogonal makes the distinction.

Motivation: $\vec{u}$ seems to be `aligned' with major direction of the elliptic trajectory in the Lorentz-orthogonal subspace, generated by the action of its cross-product. Show this formally by making use of the eigenvectors.

The basis vectors $ \qty{\vec{e}_2, \vec{e}_3}$, where $\vec{e}_2$ is the orthogonal projection of the vector $\vec{e}_1 = \uvec{u}$ on its Lorentz-orthogonal subspace, and $\vec{e}_3 \triangleq \lorcrossp{\vec{e}_1}{\vec{e}_2}$, form the real and imaginary parts of two of the eigenvectors of the matrix $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$. 

Because the basis vectors $\vec{e}_2$ and $\vec{e}_3$ are also orthogonal in the Euclidean sense, the 

\begin{proof}
    Let $\uvec{u} = u_1\uvec{i} + u_2\uvec{j} + u_3\uvec{k}$. A normal vector to the Lorentz-orthogonal subspace is $
    \uvec{n} = u_1\uvec{i} - u_2\uvec{j} - u_3\uvec{k}$. Then, the basis vectors are
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
            \vec{e}_2 &= 
            \uvec{u} - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \uvec{n} \\
            \vec{e}_3 &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2} = -\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}}),
        \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    because the Lorentz-cross product distributes over addition and $\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{u}} = \vec{0}$. The proposition above claims that $\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3$ is an eigenvector of the matrix $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$. Hence, it must be the case that $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3) = \lambda(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3)$, where $\lambda$ is then an eigenvalue of the matrix. This can be verified by replacing the action of $\mat{U}_{\lorcrossp{}{}}$ with the cross product. Plugging in the definition and exploiting the linearity of the Lorentz cross-product, we obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\vec{e}_2 + \ii\vec{e}_3)} 
            &= \lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2} +
        \ii\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_3}) \\
            &= \vec{e}_3 + \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_3})\ii \\ 
            &=\vec{e}_3 +  \qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\vec{e}_2})})\ii \\
            &=\vec{e}_3 -  \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}})})\ii.  \\
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
The triple cross-product expansion, or `Lagrange formula', relates the regular cross product to the corresponding dot product:
    $$ \vec{a}\times\qty(\vec{b}\times\vec{c}) = \vec{b}\:\inner{\vec{c}}{\vec{a}} - \vec{c}\:\inner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}. $$
This well-known identity generalizes (easily verified) to the Lorentzian counterpart of the cross- and inner products:
    $$ 
        \lorcrossp{\vec{a}}{\qty(\lorcrossp{\vec{b}}{\vec{c}})} 
       = \vec{b}\:\lorinner{\vec{c}}{\vec{a}} - \vec{c}\:\lorinner{\vec{a}}{\vec{b}}. 
    $$
Using the Lagrange formula, the above expression becomes
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            & \vec{e}_3 - \frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} }\qty(\uvec{u}\,\lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} - \uvec{n}\lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{u}})\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \qty(\uvec{u}\,\frac{ \lorinner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} \, \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} } - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \qty(\uvec{u} - \uvec{n}\frac{ \inner{\uvec{u}}{\uvec{n}} }{ \inner{\uvec{n}}{\uvec{n}} })\ii \\
            & =\, \vec{e}_3 - \vec{e}_2\ii. 
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The latter is the scalar multiple of the vector $\vec{e}_2 + \vec{e}_3$ by $-\ii$ - hence, this is indeed an eigenvector of the corresponding matrix.
\end{proof}
Because $\vec{e}_2$ and $\vec{e}_3$ are also orthogonal in the normal sense, they are aligned with the major axes of the elliptic trajectories generated by the cross product. Hence, they can be used to find a basis of the invariant subspace which makes the trajectories identical to those in the phase plane.
