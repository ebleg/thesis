\chapter{Geometric Structures in Dissipative Mechanics}
\label{chap:geometric_structures}

In this chapter, we develop a geometric structure that can be used a construct Hamiltonian formalism for mechanical systems with dissipative elements. This formalism may also be applied to economic engineering systems using the analogies outlined in \cref{chap:symplectic_economics}.

Throughout this chapter, we progressively extend the conventional Hamiltonian formalism to more `advanced' types of manifolds.

First, in \cref{sec:symplectic}, the conventional Hamiltonian theory based on symplectic manifolds is explained. This section serves as a technical introduction to the rest of the chapter and does not contain new contributions.

Second, in \cref{sec:contact}, we look at \emph{contact Hamiltonian systems} defined on contact manifolds. These have been proposed by some authors for dissipative mechanical systems (in particular, the damped harmonic oscillator) in the past \cite{Bravetti2015}. However, we propose a different formulation of the contact structure based on physical reasoning instead of a purely mathematical one. Moreover, we show how the Caldirola-Kanai model is directly equivalent to the symplectification of the contact Hamiltonian system.

Third, in \cref{sec:jacobi}, we point out by means of an example why contact Hamiltonian systems are not able to describe general (multi-degree of freedom) mechanical systems. A (slight) generalization of contact manifolds is required instead, these are part of the general class \emph{Jacobi manifolds} that also includes symplectic and contact manifolds as particular instances. 

The extension towards Jacobi manifolds has been proposed by \citet{ciaglia2018}, but it has received little to no additional attention in literature --- at least, not regarding their application to mechanical systems. We formulate the Jacobi structure using the same physical reasoning as for the contact Hamiltonian systems.
