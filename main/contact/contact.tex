\chapter{Liouville and Contact Geometry for Dissipative Systems}
\label{chap:contact_mechanics} 
%The contact-geometric counterpart of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics has been the subject of increasing academic interest in recent years, see for example \citet{VanderSchaft2021a,VanderSchaft2018,Maschke2018,Bravetti2017,DeLeon2020}, etc. The conception of the idea arguably traces back to the work of Herglotz \cite{Guenther1996}, who derived it using the variational principle, and the developments in differential geometry, by e.g. \citet{Arnold1989,Arnold1989a,Arnold1989b,Arnold1991} and \citet{Libermann1987}.
%
%In this chapter, the direct connection is made between the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian given by \cref{eq:ham_CK} and the contact Hamiltonian described by \citet{Bravetti2017}, using Liouville geometry\footnote{It is interesting to note that Bravetti gives the Caldirola-Kanai method as an example of dissipative Hamiltonians in his paper, but fails to make the connection with his own method.}. We then proceed to \emph{contact Lagrangian mechanics}, strongly related to the Herglotz' work. Finally, the whole theory is explained from a thermodynamic perspective as well. While it was already known for some time (dating back to Arnol'd) that contact geometry from fitting geometrical framework for thermodynamics, its equivalence to contact geometry in (dissipative) classical mechanics has not been desribed in past literature. This underpins a famous statement by Vladimir Arnol'd that `contact geometry is all geometry', in the sense that conservative mechanical systems can be considered as part of a larger class of systems for which energy dissipation \emph{is} allowed. \cite{Geiges2008}
%
%The traditional picture is that Hamiltonian mechanics takes place in the space of generalized positions and momenta, colloquialy denoted by $q$'s and $p$'s. The generalized positions form coordinates of the configuration manifold, which encodes all the possible positions that the system can find itself in. The momenta, on the other hand, are \emph{cotangent variables}: they live in the cotangent space of linear functions acting on tangent (velocity) vectors to the configuration manifold $Q$. We say that the Hamiltonian is a function on the \emph{cotangent bundle} to the configuration manifold $\ctbundle{Q}$. This cotangent bundle has a canonical `symplectic' structure, given by its symplectic form $\omega$, that pairs every position direction with its corresponding momenta:
%$$ \omega = \sum \wedgep{\dd{q^i}}{\dd{p_i}}. $$
%A vital property of symplectic manifolds (which include the cotangent bundle) is the fact that they are always even-dimensional: every position coordinate has a corresponding momentum and vice versa. Likewise, in an economic context this asserts that every product has its own price. It is precisely this symmetry that is broken by the introduction of contact manifolds.
%
%The symplectic structure of Hamiltonian mechanics is related to the conservation of energy principle. The Hamiltonian function is conserved along the integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field that it generates. In contrast, for dissipative mechanics, this strict reciprocity between position and momentum is broken. Either, one constructs an explicit time-dependence and acknowledges the special nature of time, or one can introduce another coordinate that acts as `reservoir' to facilitate the dissipation in the system. These Hamiltonian systems are known as n\emph{contact Hamiltonian systems}. 

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:contact_intro}
%\subsection{Historical perspective} 
The traditional theory of Hamiltonian mechanics based on symplectic manifolds does not include energy dissipation without an explicit time dependence. Some efforts have been made to extend the formalism to dissipative systems; the celebrated report by \citet{Dekker1981} provides an excellent overview of the advances in this field. Roughly speaking, four approaches exist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{Bateman approach}, doubles the number of degrees of freedom in the system to create a `mirror system' that runs in the opposite time direction \cite{Bateman1931}. In the overall system the irreversible (i.e. dependent on the direction of time) effects, cancel out due to the two time directions, which is why it admits a symplectic structure.
    \item The family of \emph{complex dissipative Hamiltonians} proposed in various forms by \citet{Bopp1974}, \citet{Dekker1975}, \citet{Dedene1980}, \citet{Rajeev2007}, and more recently, \citet{Hutters2020} in the research group of the author. Originally, this method was developed to facilitate the quantization of dissipative mechanics for applications in quantum mechanics. The relation of the work in this thesis with the complex dissipative Hamiltonians is given in \cref{ssec:complex_ham}.
    \item Some purely mathematical constructs have been devised as well, e.g. by \citet{Havas1957} solving the so-called Helmholtz conditions. These \emph{mathematical Hamiltonians} do not offer insights from a physical standpoint (i.e. the Hamiltonian representing the energy in the system); and they rely on singularities of the Hamiltonian function to get around the inevitable limitations imposed by de Rham's theorem (this point is discussed in greater detail later in \cref{sec:liouville}).
    \item Finally, the time-dependent Hamiltonian (and Lagrangian) functions include the dissipative action through an explicit time-dependence that takes care of the `energy shrinkage' of the system. Though reinvented by several authors, this approach is commonly attributed to \citet{Caldirola1941} and \citet{Kanai1948}, which it is why it is usually referred to as the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian \cite{Schuch1997,Tokieda2021}.
\end{itemize}
In addition, for practical (engineering) applications with dissipation the \emph{Rayleigh damping function} is often used in the Lagrangian setting \cite{Goldstein2011}. Although this damping function produces the correct equations of motion for linear damping, it does not conform to the deeper symplectic structure underlying Hamiltonian (and also Lagrangian) mechanics. Hence, we consider this an \emph{ad hoc} method, and we we will not be concerned with it in this thesis.

%\subsection{Contact Hamiltonian systems} 
In this chapter, a contrasting approach from the described methods is taken: instead of trying to fit the dissipation into the symplectic framework, we propose that \emph{contact geometry}, rather than symplectic geometry, is the natural setting for problems that include dissipation. Contact geometry is often called the odd-dimensional counterpart of symplectic geometry, and for good reason: one can see a contact manifold as a symplectic manifold, with one extra dimension which can be identified through the contact structure as `special'. Along the same line, the symplectic Hamiltonian formalism can be extended to contact manifolds as well, resulting in \emph{contact Hamiltonian systems}. For the reader unfamiliar with this subject, a concise introduction to contact geometry and contact Hamiltonian systems is given in \cref{app:contact_geometry}. For a more extensive overview we refer to \citet{Geiges2008} and \citet{Libermann1987}.

This chapter is organized according to two typical ways to study contact manifolds (and the associated Hamiltonian systems). Firstly, in \cref{sec:thermodynamics}, we combine the theory of contact Hamiltonian systems and the principles of thermodynamics to derive the Hamiltonian function and contact structure for the damped harmonic oscillator. The contact Hamiltonian system is necessarily is defined on an odd-dimensional manifold: on top of the classical position-momentum pair, we need an extra coordinate to keep track of the dissipation in the system. 

Secondly, in \cref{sec:liouville}, we take a different route: rather than using the contact structure directly, we follow a procedure called \emph{symplectization} to cast the contact Hamiltonian system on a symplectic manifold with an additional \emph{Liouville structure}. This procedure goes at the expense of yet another dimension added to the manifold, for symplectic manifolds are necessarily even-dimensional. 
In addition, this method shows how the form of the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is a direct consequence of the resulting symplectified Hamiltonian system.

Thirdly, \cref{sec:lagrangian} treats the transition from contact Hamiltonian systems to contact Lagrangian systems. Finally, \cref{sec:generalization} shows how the theory can be extended to slightly more complicated mechanical systems, including those with exogeneous inputs.

%Furthermore, the symplectic part of the contact structure does the usual job of `pairing' the other coordinate directions. In the language of mechanics, these pairings are the generalized positions and their conjugate momenta. As demonstrated by \citet{Arnold1989}, the notion of Hamiltonian systems on symplectic manifolds can be extended to contact Hamiltonian systems on contact manifolds. It is this \emph{contact Hamiltonian formalism} that will be used to describe the mechanics of dissipative mechanical systems. 
%There are generally two ways to study contact manifolds: one is directly through the contact structure, another is to use the so-called symplectization. The symplectization of a contact manifold adds another dimension to the contact manifold and assigns it a symplectic structure (instead of a contact structure) in a canonical fashion. Due to the canonical nature of this conversion, the symplectified manifold can serve as a fine representative of the underlying contact manifold \cite{Arnold1989}.
%This chapter follows each of these two methods to arive at the same result:
%In \cref{sec:thermodynamics}, the basic principles from thermodynamics (and the associated contact structure) are used to provide a constructive argument for the correct contact Hamiltonian system for the damped harmonic oscillator. The corresponding Hamiltonian has already been shown by \citet{Bravetti2017} to generate the correct equations of motion, but his argument is neither constructive, nor does it provide the correct interpretation of the mathematical structure.
%In \cref{sec:liouville} the symplectification of the contact Hamiltonian system is used to show that the time-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is actually a time-explicit version of the symplectified contact Hamiltonian system derived in \cref{sec:thermodynamics}.

%Both viewpoints have their advantages: the contact structure corresponds directly to the physical states of the system, but the mathematics of contact Hamiltonian systems has little of the mathematical elegance and simplicity that a purely symplectic system offers. Also from a computational viewpoint, the symplectification is a lot more approachable, since we can use traditional tools such as Poisson brackets to perform calculations.
