\section{Introduction}

%\subsection{Historical perspective} 
The traditional theory of Hamiltonian mechanics based on symplectic manifolds does not include energy dissipation without an explicit time dependence. A famous example is the time-dependent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions modeling the linearly damped harmonic oscillator, which is commonly attributed to \citet{Caldirola1941} and \citet{Kanai1948}\footnote{We will hence refer to it as the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian (or Lagrangian).}. 
These systems are nonautonomous, which is to say that the phenomenon of dissipation is essentially treated to be \emph{exogeneous} from the perspective of the system.  

To the engineer, this does not seem natural at all. Every physical system, be it mechanical, electrical, economic, or otherwise, includes dissipative elements in some shape or form. These elements are inherent to the system: exogenous effects are typically reserved for externally controlled inputs or disturbances. Hence, from an engineering point of view, we seek to include the dissipative elements as phenomena that are \emph{endogeneous} to the system itself.

Some efforts have been made in the past to resolve this issue by extending the Hamiltonian formalism: the celebrated report by \citet{Dekker1981} provides an excellent overview of the advances in this field. Roughly speaking, three approaches exist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{Bateman approach}, doubles the number of degrees of freedom in the system to create a `mirror system' that runs in the opposite time direction \cite{Bateman1931}. In the overall system the irreversible (i.e. dependent on the direction of time) effects, cancel out due to the two time directions, which is why it admits a symplectic structure.
    \item The family of \emph{complex dissipative Hamiltonians} proposed in various forms by \citet{Bopp1974}, \citet{Dekker1975}, \citet{Dedene1980}, \citet{Rajeev2007}, and more recently, \citet{Hutters2020} in the research group of the author. Originally, this method was developed to facilitate the quantization of dissipative mechanics for applications in quantum mechanics. The relation of the work in this thesis with the complex dissipative Hamiltonians is given in \cref{ssec:complex_ham}.
    \item Some purely \emph{mathematical Hamiltonians} have been devised as well, e.g. by \citet{Havas1957} solving the so-called Helmholtz conditions. These Hamiltonians produce the correct equations of motion but bear no connection to the energy in the system.
\end{itemize}
Although all of these methods work, they have some limitations for practical applications. The Bateman approach results in a system with twice the dimensions, but most (at least half) of these are redundant. This is because dissipation is in essence a first-order effect: as will be shown in this chapter, at most one additional dimension is required to model the dissipation. The complex Hamiltonians are mathematically elegant but lack physical interpretation of the canonical  coordinates and the Hamiltonian function. Finally, the mathematical Hamiltonians do not offer insights from a physical standpoint. Furthermore, they rely on singularities of the Hamiltonian function to circumvent the inevitable limitations imposed by de Rham's theorem (this point is discussed in greater detail later in \cref{sec:liouville}).

In addition, we remark that it is common practice in engineering applications to include the \emph{Rayleigh damping function} in the Lagrangian function \cite{Goldstein2011} to represent linearly damped elements. Although this damping function produces the correct equations of motion for linear damping, it does not conform to the deeper symplectic structure underlying Hamiltonian (and also Lagrangian) mechanics. Hence, we consider this an \emph{ad hoc} method, and we will not be further concerned with it in this thesis.

The purpose of this chapter is to propose a different framework that is both mathematically elegant \emph{and} physically interpretable, to make it suitable for practical applications. Instead of trying to fit the dissipation into the symplectic framework, we propose that \emph{contact manifolds} (instead of symplectic manifolds) are the natural setting for problems that include dissipation. Contact manifolds are necessarily odd-dimensional: next to the canonical pairs of positions of momenta, an extra coordinate is included that absorbs the dissipated energy. The Hamiltonian formalism can be extended from symplectic manifolds to contact manifolds as well. We will use this \emph{contact Hamiltonian formalism} to describe dissipative mechanical systems.

This chapter takes two different paths to arrive at a single contact Hamiltonian representation of the damped harmonic oscillator, which serves as an exemplary dissipative system. These two paths are based on two parallel mathematical representations of a contact manifold: one is the contact structure itself, while the other is its \emph{symplectification}. This is a procedure to cast the contact Hamiltonian system on a symplectic manifold with an additional \emph{Liouville structure}. This procedure goes at the expense of yet another dimension added to the manifold, making it even-dimensional again.

Firstly, in \cref{sec:thermodynamics}, we use the principles of thermodynamics to derive the contact Hamiltonian representation of the damped harmonic oscillator. Secondly, in \cref{sec:liouville}, we look at the symplectification of the manifold and derive an equivalent symplectified Hamiltonian system argued motivated by the form of the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian.

We then proceed by transforming the contact Hamiltonian representation of the damped harmonic oscillator to the contact Lagrangian representation in \cref{sec:lagrangian}. Finally, \cref{sec:generalization} shows how the same principles can be used to model more complicated mechanical systems, including those with exogenous inputs.
