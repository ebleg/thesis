\chapter{Liouville and Contact Geometry for Dissipative Systems}
\label{chap:contact_mechanics} 
%The contact-geometric counterpart of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics has been the subject of increasing academic interest in recent years, see for example \citet{VanderSchaft2021a,VanderSchaft2018,Maschke2018,Bravetti2017,DeLeon2020}, etc. The conception of the idea arguably traces back to the work of Herglotz \cite{Guenther1996}, who derived it using the variational principle, and the developments in differential geometry, by e.g. \citet{Arnold1989,Arnold1989a,Arnold1989b,Arnold1991} and \citet{Libermann1987}.
%
%In this chapter, the direct connection is made between the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian given by \cref{eq:ham_CK} and the contact Hamiltonian described by \citet{Bravetti2017}, using Liouville geometry\footnote{It is interesting to note that Bravetti gives the Caldirola-Kanai method as an example of dissipative Hamiltonians in his paper, but fails to make the connection with his own method.}. We then proceed to \emph{contact Lagrangian mechanics}, strongly related to the Herglotz' work. Finally, the whole theory is explained from a thermodynamic perspective as well. While it was already known for some time (dating back to Arnol'd) that contact geometry from fitting geometrical framework for thermodynamics, its equivalence to contact geometry in (dissipative) classical mechanics has not been desribed in past literature. This underpins a famous statement by Vladimir Arnol'd that `contact geometry is all geometry', in the sense that conservative mechanical systems can be considered as part of a larger class of systems for which energy dissipation \emph{is} allowed. \cite{Geiges2008}
%
%The traditional picture is that Hamiltonian mechanics takes place in the space of generalized positions and momenta, colloquialy denoted by $q$'s and $p$'s. The generalized positions form coordinates of the configuration manifold, which encodes all the possible positions that the system can find itself in. The momenta, on the other hand, are \emph{cotangent variables}: they live in the cotangent space of linear functions acting on tangent (velocity) vectors to the configuration manifold $Q$. We say that the Hamiltonian is a function on the \emph{cotangent bundle} to the configuration manifold $\ctbundle{Q}$. This cotangent bundle has a canonical `symplectic' structure, given by its symplectic form $\omega$, that pairs every position direction with its corresponding momenta:
%$$ \omega = \sum \wedgep{\dd{q^i}}{\dd{p_i}}. $$
%A vital property of symplectic manifolds (which include the cotangent bundle) is the fact that they are always even-dimensional: every position coordinate has a corresponding momentum and vice versa. Likewise, in an economic context this asserts that every product has its own price. It is precisely this symmetry that is broken by the introduction of contact manifolds.
%
%The symplectic structure of Hamiltonian mechanics is related to the conservation of energy principle. The Hamiltonian function is conserved along the integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field that it generates. In contrast, for dissipative mechanics, this strict reciprocity between position and momentum is broken. Either, one constructs an explicit time-dependence and acknowledges the special nature of time, or one can introduce another coordinate that acts as `reservoir' to facilitate the dissipation in the system. These Hamiltonian systems are known as n\emph{contact Hamiltonian systems}. 

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Historical perspective} The traditional symplectic structure of Hamiltonian systems does not intrinsically support energy dissipation. Some efforts have been made to make this possible; the celebrated report by \citet{Dekker1981} provides an excellent overview of the advances on this field. Roughly, four approaches exist:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \emph{Bateman approach}, doubles the number of degrees of freedom in the system to create a `mirror system' that runs in the opposite time direction. \cite{Bateman1931}. In the overall system the irreversible effects cancel out due to the two time directions, which is why it behaves in a symplectic fashion.
    \item The family of \emph{complex dissipative Hamiltonians} proposed in various forms by \citet{Bopp1974}, \citet{Dekker1975}, \citet{Dedene1980}, \citet{Rajeev2007}, and more recently, \citet{Hutters2020} in the research group of the author. Originally, this method was developed to facilitate the quantization of dissipative mechanics for applications in quantum mechanics. The relation of the work in this thesis with the complex dissipative Hamiltonians is given in \cref{ssec:complex_ham}.
    \item Some purely mathematical constructs have been devised as well, e.g. by \citet{Havas1957} solving the so-called Helmholtz conditions. These \emph{mathematical Hamiltonians} do not offer insights from a physical standpoint (i.e. the Hamiltonian representing the energy in the system); and they rely on singularities of the Hamiltonian function to get around the inevitable limitations imposed by de Rham's theorem (this point is discussed in greater detail later in \cref{sec:liouville}).
    \item Finally, the time-dependent Hamiltonian (and Lagrangian) functions include the dissipative action through an explicit time-dependence that takes care of the `energy shrinkage' of the system. Although reinvented by several authors, this approach is commonly attributed to \citet{Caldirola1941} and \citet{Kanai1948}, which it is why it is usually referred to as the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, there is the Rayleigh damping function that is used in the Lagrangian setting for practical applications. However, this damping function does not obey the mathematical structure that the methods mentioned earlier try to comply with. Hence, we consider this purely ad hoc \emph{ad hoc} method, and we we will not be concerned with it in this thesis. \cite{Goldstein2011}

\paragraph{Contact Hamiltonian systems} In this chapter, a different approach from the described methods is taken: instead of trying to force the dissipation into the symplectic framework, we acknowledge that symplectic manifolds are \emph{not} the natural setting for dissipative mechanics. We turn towards a different, but closely related, type of geometry called \emph{contact geometry}. Contact geometry is often called `the odd-dimensional counterpart of symplectic geometry', and for good reason. Indeed, one can see a contact manifold as a symplectic manifold, with one extra dimension which can be identified through the contact structure as special. Furthermore, the symplectic part of the contact structure does the usual job of `pairing' the other coordinate directions --- in the language of mechanics, these are the generalized positions and their respective momenta. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian formalism can also naturally be extended from symplectic manifolds to contact manifolds, as demonstrated by \citet{Arnold1989}. It is this \emph{contact Hamiltonian formalism} that will be used to describe the mechanics of dissipative mechanical systems. A concise summary of contact geometry and contact Hamiltonian systems is given in \cref{app:contact_geometry}.

There are generally two ways to look at contact manifolds: one is to use the contact structure directly, and one is to use the so-called symplectization. This chapter follows each of these two angles to arive at the same result:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cref{sec:thermodynamics}, the basic principles from thermodynamics (and the associated contact structure) are used to provide a constructive argument for the correct contact Hamiltonian system for the damped harmonic oscillator. The corresponding Hamiltonian has already been shown by \citet{Bravetti2017} to generate the correct equations of motion, but his argument is neither constructive, nor does it provide the correct interpretation of the mathematical structure.
    \item In \cref{sec:liouville} the symplectification of the contact Hamiltonian system is used. To add a dimension to an already odd-dimensional manifold makes it even-dimensional again. It is a delightful mathematical fact that we can add this dimension in a canonical fashion, i.e. without requiring additional structure (which would need physical meaning). Even more delightful is that this newly formed even-dimensional manifold has a canonical symplectic structure. Because this \emph{symplectification} of the contact manifold is canonical, it can serve as a fine representative of the contact manifold itself. This method is used to show that the time-dependent Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian is actually a time-explicit version of the symplectified contact Hamiltonian system derived in \cref{sec:thermodynamics}.
\end{itemize}
Both viewpoints have their advantages: the contact structure corresponds directly to the physical states of the system, but the mathematics of contact Hamiltonian systems has little of the mathematical elegance that a purely symplectic system offers (e.g. the availability of Poisson brackets for computation). Also from a computational viewpoint, the symplectification is a lot more approachable, since we can use traditional tools such as Poisson brackets to perform calculations.

\paragraph{Notation} This chapter is primarily concerned with the prototypical dissipative mechanical system: the linearly damped harmonic oscillator depicted in \cref{fig:dho}, with the governing second-order differential equation being
\begin{equation}  
  m\ddot{q} + b\dot{q} + kq = 0,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass of the object, $b$ the damping coefficient, and $k$ the spring constant. However, we prefer to express the dynamics in terms of some other parameters which are derived from these quantities; they are defined in \cref{tab:dho_params}.

The choice of the damped harmonic oscillator as examplary system is rather perspicuous, since it is arguably the `easiest' dissipative system that also exhibits second-order dynamics and is linear in all terms. Furthermore, as discussed below, it serves as the test case of choice in the overwhelming majority of research into dissipative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics \cite{Dekker1981,Hutters2020}.

Position coordinates are denoted by $q$ (with optional subscript), while $p$ refers to the associated (generalized) momentum. We denote the symplectic 2-form by $\omega$, the Liouville 1-form by $\theta$ and the contact form by $\alpha$.

%However, the method described in this section can be generalized directly to a general (possibly time-dependent) potential function $V = V(q, t)$. To make calculations and notation easier, some special parameters are frequently used throughout this chapter, they are summarized in \cref{tab:dho_params}.
