\chapter{Liouville Geometry for Dissipative Systems}
\label{chap:contact_mechanics}
The contact-geometric counterpart of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics has been the subject of increasing academic interest in recent years, see for example \citet{VanderSchaft2021a,VanderSchaft2018,Maschke2018,Bravetti2017,DeLeon2020}, etc. The conception of the idea arguably traces back to the work of Herglotz \cite{Guenther1996}, who derived it using the variational principle, and the developments in differential geometry, by e.g. \citet{Arnold1989,Arnold1989a,Arnold1989b,Arnold1991} and \citet{Libermann1987}.

In this chapter, the direct connection is made between the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian given by \cref{eq:ham_CK} and the contact Hamiltonian described by \citet{Bravetti2017}, using Liouville geometry\footnote{It is interesting to note that Bravetti gives the Caldirola-Kanai method as an example of dissipative Hamiltonians in his paper, but fails to make the connection with his own method.}. We then proceed to \emph{contact Lagrangian mechanics}, strongly related to the Herglotz' work. Finally, the whole theory is explained from a thermodynamic perspective as well. While it was already known for some time (dating back to Arnol'd) that contact geometry from fitting geometrical framework for thermodynamics, its equivalence to contact geometry in (dissipative) classical mechanics has not been desribed in past literature. This underpins a famous statement by Vladimir Arnol'd that `contact geometry is all geometry', in the sense that conservative mechanical systems can be considered as part of a larger class of systems for which energy dissipation \emph{is} allowed. \cite{Geiges2008}

The traditional picture is that Hamiltonian mechanics takes place in the space of generalized positions and momenta, colloquialy denoted by $q$'s and $p$'s. The generalized positions form coordinates of the configuration manifold, which encodes all the possible positions that the system can find itself in. The momenta, on the other hand, are \emph{cotangent variables}: they live in the cotangent space of linear functions acting on tangent (velocity) vectors to the configuration manifold $Q$. We say that the Hamiltonian is a function on the \emph{cotangent bundle} to the configuration manifold $\ctbundle{Q}$. This cotangent bundle has a canonical `symplectic' structure, given by its symplectic form $\omega$, that pairs every position direction with its corresponding momenta:
$$ \omega = \sum \wedgep{\dd{q^i}}{\dd{p_i}}. $$
A vital property of symplectic manifolds (which include the cotangent bundle) is the fact that they are always even-dimensional: every position coordinate has a corresponding momentum and vice versa. Likewise, in an economic context this asserts that every product has its own price. It is precisely this symmetry that is broken by the introduction of contact manifolds.

The symplectic structure of Hamiltonian mechanics is related to the conservation of energy principle. The Hamiltonian function is conserved along the integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector field that it generates. In contrast, for dissipative mechanics, this strict reciprocity between position and momentum is broken. Either, one constructs an explicit time-dependence and acknowledges the special nature of time, or one can introduce another coordinate that acts as `reservoir' to facilitate the dissipation in the system. These Hamiltonian systems are known as \emph{contact Hamiltonian systems}.

\paragraph{Damped harmonic oscillator} This chapter (and the application in the following chapter) is primarily concerned with the prototypical dissipative mechanical system: the linearly damped harmonic oscillator depicted in \cref{fig:dho}, with the governing second-order differential equation being
\begin{equation}  
  m\ddot{q} + b\dot{q} + kq = 0.
\end{equation}
The choice for this system is rather perspicuous, since it is arguably the `easiest' dissipative system that also exhibits second-order dynamics and is linear in all terms. Furthermore, as discussed below, it serves as the test case of choice in the overwhelming majority of research into dissipative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
\cite{Dekker1981,Hutters2020b}. However, the method described in this section can be generalized directly to a general (possibly time-dependent) potential function $V = V(q, t)$. To make calculations and notation easier, some special parameters are frequently used throughout this chapter, they are summarized in \cref{tab:dho_params}.
