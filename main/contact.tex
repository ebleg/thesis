\chapter{Symplectified Contact Mechanics for Dissipative Systems}

The traditional view is that the methods of analytical mechanics, such as the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, are
only suited for conservative systems. However, several attempts, especially in the previous century, have been made to
extend these principles to dissipative systems as well. 

\section{The damped harmonic oscillator}
This chapter (and the application in the following chapter) is primarily concerned with the prototypical dissipative mechanical system: the linearly damped harmonic oscillator depicted in \cref{fig:dho}, with the governing second-order differential equation being
\begin{equation}  
  m\ddot{q} + b\dot{q} + kq = 0.
\end{equation}
The choice for this system is rather perspicuous, since it is arguably the `easiest` dissipative system that also exhibits second-order dynamics and is linear in all terms. Furthermore, as discussed below, it serves as the test case of the overwhelming majority of research into dissipative Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
\cite{Dekker1981,Hutters2020b}. However, the method described in this section can be generalized directly to a general (possibly time-dependent) potential function $V = V(q, t)$.

%The first attempt is arguably made in the work of \citet{Bateman1931} in 1931, who used a `mirror` system in
%combination with the real system that runs with an opposite time direction --- as such, the irreversible dynamics are
%compensated by the mirror system, which ensures that the overal system can be cast in the necessarily even-dimensional
%(the Bateman approach automatically doubles the number of dimensions in the system) symplectic setting that underpins
%the Hamiltonian formalism\footnote{Strictly speaking, Bateman only covered the Lagrangian part of the story in his
%paper}.

\section{Historical perspectives}
A traditional, engineering-inclined method to incorporate damping in the framework is to include a Rayleigh damping term in the Lagrangian to emulate linear damping forces, and this works `mathematically` to derive the correct equations of motion \cite{Goldstein2011}. Although frequently used for practical problems, this damping term is not really part of the \emph{actual} Lagrangian --- rather, it simply makes use of the notion of a generalized force that is not inherently part of the system. As such, this method only `works' on a superficial level: the pristine differential geometric foundations of mechanics do not leave room for such ad hoc tricks. There is, as a result, also no Hamiltonian counterpart for this method. 

The historical attempts to do better than the Rayleigh method were primarily motivated by the application of the (dissipative) Hamiltonian formalism in quantum mechanics through discretization. For this application, a sound mathematical structure is of the essence, which calls for a more rigorous approach. A celebrated paper by
\citet{Dekker1981} provides an excellent summary of many attempts up to 1981. Indeed, the well-studied approach developed by \citet{Caldirola1941} and \citet{Kanai1948} was intended exactly for this purpose. This method features an explicit time-dependence both in the Lagrangian function
\begin{equation}
    \Lck(q, \dot{q}, t) = \ec^{\gamma t}\qty(\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}^2 - \frac{1}{2}kq^2),
    \label{eq:lag_CK}
\end{equation}
and the corresponding Hamiltonian function:
\begin{equation}
    \Hck(q, \Pcan, t) = \frac{\Pcan^2}{2m}\ec^{-\gamma t} + \frac{1}{2}kq^2\ec^{\gamma t}.
    \label{eq:ham_CK}
\end{equation}
In latter equation, $\Pcan$ refers to a special `canonical momentum', that is
$$ \Pcan \equiv \pdv{\Lck}{\dot{q}}, $$
which is related to the `true` kinematic momentum by the relation $\Pcan = p\ec^{\gamma
t} = m\dot{q}\ec^{\gamma t}$. As such, it is also clear that the Caldirola-Kanai Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are related by the Legendre transform \emph{with respect to the canonical momentum}:\footnote{The `Legendre transform'
refers, in the context of fiber bundles, to the so-called fiber derivative. On a manifold $M$, let $L \in
\functions{M}$. Then the fiber derivative is defined als 
    $$ \fiberder{L}: \tbundle{L}\to\ctbundle{L}: \fiberder{L}(\vec{v})\cdot\vec{w} = \left. \dv{}{s}\right\vert_{s = 0} L(\vec{v} +
    s\vec{w}). $$
 Hence, the Legendre transform is in the first place the mapping that associates the generalized velocities with the
 associated (canonical) generalized momenta. Importantly, this mapping is a diffeomorphism (that is, invertible and onto) if the Hessian of
 $L$ is nondegenerate - roughly equivalent to the statement that every generalized velocity has an associated `mass` to
 it. \cite{Marsden1998}.}
$$ \Hck = \Pcan \dot{q} - \Lck. $$
From either \cref{eq:lag_CK} or \cref{eq:ham_CK}, the equations of motion are readily
derived (for the Hamiltonian case with respect to $\Pcan$ after which the transformation to $p$ can be effected).
Indeed, after taking the appropriate derivatives, one obtains:
\begin{equation*} 
    \begin{split}
        \dv{}{t}\qty(\pdv{\Lck}{\dot{q}}) - \pdv{\Lck}{q} &= 0 \\
        \Rightarrow \ec^{\gamma t}\qty(m\ddot{q} + m\gamma\dot{q} + kq) &= 0
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
for the Lagrangian case. Likewise, Hamilton's equations yield: \cite{Tokieda2021}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{q} &= \pdv{\Hck}{\Pcan} = \frac{\Pcan}{m}\ec^{-\gamma t} =  \frac{p}{m}, \\
        \dot{\Pcan} &= -\pdv{\Hck}{q} = -kq\ec^{\gamma t}.\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
The relation between the time derivatives of the momenta $\dot{p}$ and $\dot{\Pcan}$ is slightly more involved since one must invoke the product rule as a result of their time-dependent relation:
    $$ \dot{\Pcan} = \ec^{\gamma t}\qty(\dot{p} + \gamma p). $$
Substition yields the correct equation for $p$, though the equation is again multiplied by $\ec^{\gamma t}$. Because the latter is sufficiently well-behaved (that is, it has no zeros), it can be removed without any problems.

\paragraph{Geometric perspective}
To put the above derivation in a geometric setting, define the Liouville 1-form as
$$ \alpha = \Pcan\dd{q} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = -\dd{\alpha} = \wedgep{\dd{q}}{\dd{\Pcan}},$$
where the symplectic 2-form will be used to obtain Hamilton's equations. The Hamiltonian \cref{eq:ham_CK} is explicitly time-dependent. This will give rise to a time-dependent vector field governing the solution curves.\footnote
{A \emph{time-dependent vector field} on a manifold $M$ is a mapping $X: M\times\real \to \tbundle{M}$ such that for each $t \in \real$, the restriction $X_t$ of $X$ to $M \times \{t\}$ is a vector field on $M$. \cite{Libermann1987} An additional construction of importance, called the \emph{suspension} of the vector field, is a mapping $$ \tilde{X}: \real \times M \to \tbundle{(\real \times M)} \quad (t, m) \mapsto ((t, 1), (m, X(t, m))),$$ that is to say, it lifts the vector field to the extended space that also includes $t$ and assigns the time coordinate with a trivial velocity of 1. \cite{Abraham1978}}
The construction of the vector field associated with a time-dependent Hamiltonian follows the same construction rules as a normal Hamiltonian (using the isomorphism given by $\omega$), but `frozen' at each instant of $t$. Even more bluntly speaking, one simply ignores the $t$-coordinate during the derivation, only to acknowledge the dependence at the very end. This leads to the following vector field, `suspended' on the $\real\times Q$ space:
$$ \tilde{X}_{\Hck} = -\ec^{\gamma t}kq\pdv{}{\Pcan} + \ec^{-\gamma t}\frac{\Pcan}{m}\pdv{}{q} + \pdv{}{t}.$$
The suspension is important to make the final coordinate transform from $\rho$ to $p$ work properly. Indeed, effecting the transformation $(q, \rho, t) \mapsto (q, \ec^{-\gamma t}, t)$, one obtains
$$ \tilde{X}_{\Hck} = \qty(-kq - \gamma p)\pdv{}{p} + \frac{p}{m}\pdv{}{q} + \pdv{}{t}.$$
It is worthwile to ponder on some apparent peculiarities in the Caldirola-Kanai method, for they will be explained elegantly by the contact-Hamiltonian formalism. Firstly, the role of the two-different momenta is not very clear from the get-go, apart from being a consequence of the way the Caldirola-Kanai Lagrangian is formulated. This has also been the reason for considerable confusion in the academic community (see \citet{Schuch1997}). Furthermore, there is the 

\section{Contact manifolds}

This section may be moved to an appendix.

Contact manifolds are odd-dimensional manifolds with the addition of a contact structure. This contact structure can be considered to be like a symplectic structure (which is necessarily even-dimensional) with the addition of one `special' dimension. The relation between contact structures and symplectic structures is crucial for the extension of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to contact manifolds.

\subsection{Contact structures}
A \emph{contact element} on a manifold $M$ is a point $m \in M$ combined with a tangent hyperplane $\xi_m \subset \tspace{m}{M}$ (a subspace of the tangent space  with codimension 1). The term `contact' refers to the intuitive notion that if two submanifolds `touch', they share a contact element: they are \emph{in contact} (which is a slightly weaker condition than tangency). \cite{Cannas2001} For example, contact elements to a two-dimensional manifold are simply lines through the origin in the tangent space, contact elements on a three-dimensional manifold are planes through the origin, etc.

A \emph{contact manifold} is a manifold $M$ (of dimension $2n+1$) with a \textbf{contact structure}, which is a smooth field (or distribution) of contact elements on $M$. Locally, any contact element determines a 1-form $\alpha$ (up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar) whose kernel constitutes the tangent hyperplane distribution, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \xi_m = \ker \alpha_m
    \label{eq:contact_form}
\end{equation}
This $\alpha$ is called the (local) \emph{contact form}, and it acts like a `normal (co-)vector' to the hyperplane. For the field hyperplanes to be a constact structure, it must satisfy a nondegeneracy condition: it should be \emph{nonintegrable}. This can be expressed as the the Frobenius condition for nonintegrability: \cite{Cannas2001,Abraham1978,Arnold1989}
$$ \wedgep{\alpha}{(\dd{\alpha})^n} \neq 0, $$
where integrable distributions would have this expression vanish everywhere. Roughly equivalent statements are that (i) one cannot find foliations of $M$ such that the $\xi$ is everywhere tangent to it, or (ii) that $\dd{\alpha}\vert_\xi$ is a \emph{symplectic form}. In this treatment, all contact forms are assumed to be global, which is the case if the quotient $TM/\xi$ is a trivial line bundle, i.e. the orientation is preserved across the entire manifold \cite{Geiges2008}.

The \textbf{Darboux theorem} for contact manifolds states that it is always possible to find coordinates $z, x_i, y_i$ such that locally, the contact form is equal to 
$$ \dd{z} - \sum y_i\dd{x_i}, $$
which is also called the standard or natural contact structure. The standard contact structure on $\real^3$ is illustrated in \cref{fig:standard_contact}.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \input{media/tikz/standard_contact}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The standard contact structure on $\real^3$, given by the contact form $\dd{z} - y\dd{x}$; the hyperplanes tilt more in the increasing $y$-direction.}
    \label{fig:standard_contact}
\end{figure}
Finally, it is clear that the contact form singles out a `special direction' in the tangent space at every point of the manifold. This direction is given by the unique \textbf{Reeb vector field},
$$ R_\alpha \in \vfields{M}:\quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}= 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} = 1,$$
that is, it locally points in the `direction' of the contact form.

\subsection{The manifold of contact elements}
\label{ssec:mfd_contact_elements}
It was prevously noted that a contact manifold is a manifold with a contact structure. There is, associated to any manifold $n$-dimensional manifold $Q$ a \emph{canonical} contact manifold of dimension $2n-1$, just like one can always find a canonical symplectic structure on $\ctbundle{Q}$ of dimension $2n$. Roughly speaking, this attaches a fiber containing all possible contact elements to every point of the manifold $Q$. As it turns out, this `manifold of contact elements' also has a natural contact structure.

The \emph{manifold of contact elements} of an $n$-dimensional manifold is \cite{Cannas2001}
$$ \cbundle{Q} = \qty{(q, \xi_q) \mid q \in Q \text{ and } \xi_q \text{ a hyperplane on } \tspace{q}{Q}}. $$
This manifold $\cbundle{Q}$ has dimension $2n - 1$. It is clear that $C$ has a natural bundle structure, i.e. $\bundle{C}{\pi}{Q}$ where the bundle projection `forgets' the contact element, that is
$$ \pi: \cbundle{Q} \to {Q}: (q, \xi_q) \mapsto q.$$
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \input{media/tikz/contact_element}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A point in the manifold of contact elements on $Q = \real^2$. A coordinate system for $\cbundle{Q}$ consists of $(x_0, x_1)$ to indicate a point on $Q$, and projective coordinates $[\eta_0\; : \;\eta_1]$, which denote the contact element at that point. Without loss of generalization, one can choose $\eta_0 = 1$, and the remaining coordinate $\eta_1$ covers all but one points in the projective space. A potential confusion rests in this two-dimensional example, since both the `hyperplane` and the equivalence class of 1-forms are both lines in the tangent and cotangent space respectively. This is not the case for higher-dimensions, for which $n - 1 \neq 1$.}
    \label{fig:contact_element}
\end{figure}

There is a convenient way to characterize this manifold of contact elements, for it is isomorphic to the \emph{projectivization of the cotangent bundle} to $Q$, denoted by $\pctbundle{Q}$. This projectivization can be defined in terms of an equivalence relation between two nonzero elements in the cotangent bundle at every point in the manifold:
$$ \vec{\eta},\vec{\chi}\in \ctspace{q}{Q} \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}:\quad (q, \vec{\eta}) \sim (q, \vec{\chi}) \Leftrightarrow \vec{\eta} = \lambda \vec{\chi},\quad \lambda \in \real_0, \text{ for all } q \in Q.$$
This equivalence relations identifies all the covectors in the cotangent space that are a nonzero multiple of each other. It is precisely this identification that takes care of the ambiguity in \cref{eq:contact_form}, in that any nonzero multiple of a 1-form has the same kernel, and therefore gives rise to the same contact structure. $\pctbundle{Q}$ is then the quotient set of $\ctbundle{Q}$ (without zero section) with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$. Visually, the projectivization of an $n$-dimensional vector space is the space of all \emph{lines} through the origin in that vector space, which has dimension $n - 1$. It can be shown that this space is bundle-isomorphic to the manifold $\cbundle{Q}$. \cite{Cannas2001} 

As shown in \cref{fig:contact_element}, coordinates of the equivalence class of 1-forms are `projective coordinates', $[\eta_0\;:\;\eta_1:\ldots :\eta_{n-1}]$, where $\eta_i$ are coordinates for $\ctspace{q}{Q}$. The projective coordinates acknowledge the invariance under multiplication by a nonzero number. If one assumes $\eta_0$ to be nonzero, the tuple $(1, \eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n)$ provides coordinates that cover most of $\ctspace{q}{Q}$. 

Now, it remains to be explained why the `manifold of contact elements` is itself a contact manifold. Indeed, there is a canonical field of hyperplanes \emph{on} $\cbundle{Q}$, which lifts the hyperplane tangent to $Q$ to a hyperplane tangent to $C$ (this is akin to the `tautological' trick played in the symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle). Locally, the contact form associated to this contact structure is
$$ \alpha = \dd{x}_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n \eta_i\dd{x}_i + \sum_{i=1}^n 0\dd{\eta_i}, $$
where any .

\section{Dissipative contact Hamiltonian mechanics}
The contact-geometric counterpart of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics has been the subject of increasing academic interest in recent years, see for example \citet{VanderSchaft2021a,VanderSchaft2018,Maschke2018,Bravetti2017,DeLeon2020}, etc. The conception of the idea arguably traces back to the work of Herglotz \cite{Guenther1996}, who derived it using the variational principle, and the developments in differential geometry, by e.g. \citet{Arnold1989} and \citet{Libermann1987}.

Liouville geometry arises as the result of a Liouville structure, i.e. a homogeneous form.
