\chapter{Contact Geometry}
\label{app:contact_geometry}
This appendix provides a short introduction to the basic concepts of contact geometry that are relevant in this thesis.

%Contact manifolds are odd-dimensional manifolds with the addition of a contact structure. This contact structure can be considered to be like a symplectic structure (which is necessarily even-dimensional) with the addition of one `special' dimension. The relation between contact structures and symplectic structures is crucial for the extension of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to contact manifolds.
\section{Contact structures}
\label{sec:contact_structures}
A \emph{contact element} on a manifold \(M\) is a point \(m \in M\) combined with a tangent hyperplane \(\xi_m \subset \tspace{m}{M}\) (a subspace of the tangent space  with codimension 1). The word `contact' refers to the intuitive notion that if two submanifolds touch, they share a contact element: they are \emph{in contact}. Being in contact is a slightly weaker notion than tangency, for the magnitude of the `velocity' does not matter in the former case \cite{Cannas2001}.

Contact elements to a two-dimensional manifold are simply lines through the origin in the tangent space. Contact elements to a three-dimensional manifold are planes through the origin, etc.

A \emph{contact manifold} is a manifold \(M\) (of dimension \(2n+1\)) with a \emph{contact structure}, which is a smooth field (or distribution) of contact elements on \(M\). Locally, any contact element determines a 1-form \(\alpha\) (up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar) whose kernel constitutes the tangent hyperplane distribution, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \xi_m = \ker \alpha_m
    \label{eq:contact_form}
\end{equation}
This \(\alpha\) is called the (local) \emph{contact form}, and it acts like a `normal (co-)vector' to the hyperplane. For the field hyperplanes to be a constact structure, it must satisfy a nondegeneracy condition: it should be \emph{nonintegrable}. This can be expressed as the the Frobenius condition for nonintegrability: \cite{Cannas2001,Abraham1978,Arnold1989}
\begin{equation}
     \wedgep{\alpha}{(\dd{\alpha})^n} \neq 0.
\end{equation}
Integrable distributions would have this expression vanish everywhere. Roughly equivalent statements are that (i) one cannot find foliations of \(M\) such that \(\xi\) is everywhere tangent to it, or (ii) that \(\dd{\alpha}\vert_\xi\) is a \emph{symplectic form}. 

The contact form for a contact structure may not be globally defined (e.g. in the case of the bundle of contact elements, cf. \cref{ssec:symplectification}). A contact form can only be defined globally if the quotient \(TM/\xi\) is a trivial line bundle, i.e. the orientation of the contact structure is preserved across the entire manifold \cite{Geiges2008}.

The \emph{Darboux theorem} for contact manifolds asserts that it is always possible to find local coordinates \(\qty(q^0, q^1, \ldots, q^n,\, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\), expressed in which the contact 1-form is of the form 
\begin{equation}
     \dd{q^0} - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\dd{q^i}.
\end{equation}
This is also called the \emph{standard} or \emph{natural contact structure}. The standard contact structure on \(\real^3\) is illustrated in \cref{fig:standard_contact}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/standard_contact}
    \caption{The standard contact structure on \(\real^3\), given by the contact form \(\dd{q^0} - p_1\dd{q^1}\); the hyperplanes tilt more in the increasing \(y\)-direction.}
    \label{fig:standard_contact}
\end{figure}

Finally, it is clear that the contact form singles out a special direction in the tangent space at every point of the manifold. This direction is given by the unique \emph{Reeb vector field},
\begin{equation}
    R_\alpha \in \vfields{M}:\quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}= 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} = 1. 
    \label{eq:reeb_vf}
\end{equation}
The special direction identified by the Reeb vector field is referred to as the \emph{vertical} direction. Likewise, vector field components in the direction of the Reeb vector field are vertical.

In contrast, \emph{horizontal vector fields} are those that vanish when contracted with the contact 1-form itself.

It is worth pointing out that the Reeb vector field depends on the choice of contact 1-form, and is therefore not uniquely defined up to a multiplicative constant for a given contact structure.

\section{The manifold of contact elements}
\label{ssec:mfd_contact_elements}
A contact manifold is a manifold with a contact structure. One can, however, associate a \emph{canonical} \((2n-1)\)-dimensional contact manifold to \emph{any} \(n\)-dimensional manifold \(Q\), just like one can always find a canonical symplectic structure on \(\ctbundle{Q}\). Roughly speaking, this attaches a fiber containing all possible contact elements to every point of the manifold \(Q\). As it turns out, this \emph{manifold of contact elements} has a natural contact structure.

The manifold of contact elements $\cbundle{Q}$ of an \(n\)-dimensional manifold $Q$ is defined as \cite{Cannas2001}
\begin{equation}
     \cbundle{Q} \coloneq \big\{(q, \xi_q) \mid q \in Q \text{ and } \xi_q \text{ a hyperplane on } \tspace{q}{Q}\big\}.
\end{equation}
This manifold \(\cbundle{Q}\) has dimension \(2n - 1\). 

It is clear that \(\cbundle{Q}\) has a natural bundle structure, being \(\bundle{C}{\pi}{Q}\) where the bundle projection $\pi$ forgets the contact element:
\begin{equation}
     \pi: \cbundle{Q} \to {Q}: (q, \xi_q) \mapsto q.
\end{equation}

Importantly, it can be shown that the manifold of contact elements to $Q$ is isomorphic to the \emph{projectivization of the cotangent bundle} to \(Q\), which we denoted by \(\pctbundle{Q}\). This projectivization can be defined in terms of an equivalence relation between two nonzero elements in the cotangent bundle at every point in the manifold:
\begin{equation}
     \vec{\eta},\vec{\chi}\in \ctspace{q}{Q} \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}:\quad (q, \vec{\eta}) \sim (q, \vec{\chi}) \Leftrightarrow \vec{\eta} = \lambda \vec{\chi},\quad \lambda \in \real_0, \text{ for all } q \in Q.
\end{equation}
The equivalence relation identifies all the covectors in the cotangent space that are a nonzero multiple of each other. It is precisely this identification that takes care of the ambiguity in \cref{eq:contact_form}, in that any nonzero multiple of a 1-form has the same kernel, and therefore gives rise to the same contact structure. \(\pctbundle{Q}\) is then the quotient set of \(\ctbundle{Q}\) (without zero section) with respect to the equivalence relation \(\sim\). 

Visually, the projectivization of an \(n\)-dimensional vector space is the space of all \emph{lines} through the origin in that vector space, which has dimension \(n - 1\). It can be shown that this space is bundle-isomorphic to the manifold \(\cbundle{Q}\) \cite{Cannas2001}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \input{media/tikz/contact_element}
    \caption{A point in the manifold of contact elements on \(Q = \real^2\). A coordinate system for \(\cbundle{Q}\) consists of \(q = \qty(q^0, q^1)\) to indicate a point on \(Q\), and projective coordinates \([p_0:p_1]\), which denote the contact element at that point. Without loss of generalization, one can choose \(p_0 = 1\), and the remaining coordinate \(p_1\) covers all but one points in the projective space. A potential confusion rests in this two-dimensional example, since both the `hyperplane` and the equivalence class of 1-forms are both lines in the tangent and cotangent space respectively. This is not the case for higher-dimensions, for which \(n - 1 \neq 1\).}
    \label{fig:contact_element}
\end{figure}

As shown in \cref{fig:contact_element}, coordinates of the equivalence class of 1-forms are `projective coordinates', \([p_0\;:\;p_1:\ldots :p_{n-1}]\), where \(p_i\) are coordinates for \(\ctspace{q}{Q}\). The projective coordinates acknowledge the invariance under multiplication by a nonzero number. The tuple \((1, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\) provides coordinates that cover most of \(\pctbundle{Q}\), i.e. all points where \(p_0\) is nonzero.

Now, it remains to be shown that the manifold of contact elements is itself a contact manifold. Indeed, there is a canonical field of hyperplanes \emph{on} \(\cbundle{Q}\), which lifts the hyperplane tangent to \(Q\) to a hyperplane tangent to \(\cbundle{Q}\) (this is akin to the tautological trick played in the symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle). The contact structure distinguishes the curves in \(\cbundle{Q}\) that are lifted versions from curves in \(Q\). This is illustrated in \cref{fig:contact_lift} \cite{Burke1985}.
Said otherwise, a tangent vector on \(\cbundle{Q}\) lies in the hyperplane defined by the contact structure if its projection down on \(Q\) lies in the hyperplane on \(Q\) defined by the given point on the \(\cbundle{Q}\). This contact structure is associated with the 1-form:
\begin{equation}
     \alpha = \dd{q}^0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} p_i\dd{q}^i,
\end{equation}
given where we chose the particular chart assuming that \(p_0 \neq 0\).

The canonical contact structure on the manifold of contact elements is visualized in \cref{fig:contact_lift} for a falling object. The base manifold $Q$ is two-dimensional, containing time $t$ and position $q$. A curve $\gamma$ in $Q$ can be seen as a path parameterized in time, i.e. $\gamma: t \mapsto (t, q(t))$. The contact elements are lines in the tangent spaces to $Q$: they locally represent the \emph{slope} that an arbitrary curve $q(t)$ can have. Hence, the contact variable $v$ is in this case literally interpreted as the velocity of the object. The contact structure is then 
\begin{equation}
    \alpha = \dd{q} - v\dd{t}.
\end{equation}
When the curve on $Q$ is lifted to $\cbundle{Q}$ (i.e. the space including the velocity), the contact structure forces the velocity coordinate $v$ to be equal to the actual velocity of the curve in $Q$; i.e. it selects those curves in $\cbundle{Q}$ that are lifted from the base manifold. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \input{media/tikz/contact_lift}
    \caption{Intuitive picture of the canonical contact on the manifold of contact elements. In this case, let \( (t, q) \in Q\), and let \(v\) be a coordinate for the contact (line) element. The standard contact form is then \(\dd{q} - v\dd{t}\). On the left, the curve corresponding to a falling object is shown in \(Q\). When this curve is `lifted' to \(\cbundle{Q}\), the contact structure imposes that it be locally tangent to the contact structure, or that \(v = \dv{q}{t}\). If the vertical direction is projected down onto the \((q-t)\)-plane (\(\cbundle(Q) \to Q\)), the hyperplanes defined by the contact structure are line elements tangent to the trajectory, making \(v\) the actual velocity of the curve.}
    \label{fig:contact_lift}

\section{Contact Hamiltonian systems}
\label{sec:contact_ham_systems}

\label{ssec:contact_ham_vfields}
Just like in the symplectic case, the contact Hamiltonian formalism defines an automorphism between a function on the contact manifold \(K \in \functions{M}\), and an associated `Hamiltonian' vector field \(X_K \in \vfields{M}\). While the isomorphism is rather straightforward for symplectic manifolds, the contact counterpart is more involved: this is the prime reason behind the computational advantage of symplectification, as opposed to performing the calculations directly on the contact manifold.

\subsection*{Coordinate-free derivation} Given a contact manifold \((M, \xi)\) with contact form \(\alpha\) (i.e. \(\xi \in \ker \alpha\)), the tangent bundle \(M\) can be decomposed into two subbundles: \cite{Libermann1987,Cannas2001}
\begin{equation}
     \tbundle{M} = \ker \alpha \oplus \ker \dd{\alpha},
\end{equation}
where \(\oplus\) denotes the Whitney sum. The first subbundle is referred to as the \emph{horizontal} bundle, the second as the \emph{vertical}
 bundle. The vertical subbundle is of rank 1 and its fiber is spanned by the Reeb vector field (cf. \cref{eq:reeb_vf}). As mentioned to in \cref{sec:contact_structures}, \emph{any} vector field \(X \in \vfields{M}\) may be decomposed accordingly. This decomposition is unique and given by
\begin{equation}
    X = \underbrace{(\intpr{X}{\alpha})R_\alpha}_{X^\text{ver}} + \underbrace{\qty[X - (\intpr{X}{\alpha})R_\alpha]}_{X^\text{hor}}.
    \label{eq:contact_vf_decomp}
\end{equation}
Observe that indeed \(X^\text{ver} \in \ker \dd{\alpha}\) and \(X^\text{hor} \in \ker \alpha\) \cite{Cannas2001,DeLeon2020,Libermann1987}.

We now wish to find the relation between the contact Hamiltonian \(K \in \functions{M}\) and the associated Hamiltonian vector field \(X_K \in \vfields{M}\). This one-to-one relation is uniquely determined by two conditions. Firstly, we impose that\footnote{This is the sign convention observed by \citet{Bravetti2017} en \citet{VanderSchaft2021a}, as opposed to \citet{Libermann1987}.}
    \begin{equation}
     K \coloneq -\intpr{X_K}{\alpha}.
\end{equation}
This condition already provides us with the vertical component of the Hamiltonian vector field, namely
\begin{equation}
     X_K^\text{ver} = -K R_\alpha.
\end{equation}

Secondly, the automorphism generated by the Hamiltonian vector field must be a \emph{contact automorphism}: it must preserve the contact structure. This condition is encoded in terms of the Lie derivative:\footnote
{Terminology differs somewhat in literature on this point: some authors, such as \citet{DeLeon2020} only refer to contactomorphisms as the special case where \(g = 0\); while the more general case is called \emph{conformal} contactomorphisms.}
\begin{equation}
     X_K \text{ is an infinitesimal contact automorphism} \Leftrightarrow \lied{X_K}{\alpha} = s\alpha,
\end{equation}
where \(s \in \functions{M}\). The function \(s\) is there because \(s \alpha \) and \(\alpha\) give rise to the same hyperplane distribution. 
Using Cartan's `magic' formula, the Lie derivative can be expanded as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \lied{X_K}{\alpha} &= s \alpha\\
        \dd{\qty(\intpr{X_K}{\alpha})} + \intpr{X_K}{\dd{\alpha}} &= s\alpha \\
        -\dd{K} + \intpr{X_K}{\dd{\alpha}} &= s\alpha \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Contracting both sides with the Reeb vector field yields:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \intpr{R_\alpha}{\qty(-\dd{K} + \intpr{X_K}{\dd{\alpha}})} &= \intpr{R_\alpha}{\qty(s\alpha)} \\
        -\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}} + \intpr{R_\alpha}{\intpr{X_K}{\dd{\alpha}}} &= s\,\intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} \\
        -\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}} - \intpr{X_K}{\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}} &= s.
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Hence, we have \(s = -\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}}\). Because the vertical component of \(X_K\) is spanned by the Reeb vector field, its contraction with \(\dd{\alpha}\) vanishes. As a result, we can rewrite the previous expression in terms of the \emph{horizontal} component of \(X_K\):
\begin{equation}
    \intpr{X_K}{\dd{\alpha}} = \intpr{X_K^\text{hor}}{\dd{\alpha}}=  \qty[\dd{K} - \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}})\alpha], 
    \label{eq:basic_form}
\end{equation}
We must therefore recover \(X^\text{hor}_K\) from the above expression. Define the mapping  
\begin{equation}
     \toDual{\alpha}: \tbundle{M} \to \ctbundle{M}: X \mapsto  \intpr{X}{\dd{\alpha}},
\end{equation}
when restricted to the space of horizontal vector fields, this mapping is an isomorphism onto the `semi-basic' forms\footnote{Semi-basic forms are forms that vanish when contracted with a vertical vector field \cite{Libermann1987}.}. Define the inverse mapping of \(\toDual{\alpha}\) by \(\fromDual{\alpha}\), such that
\begin{equation}
     X_K^\text{hor} = \fromDual{\alpha}\qty(\dd{K} - \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}})\,\alpha).
\end{equation}
As such, the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the contact Hamiltonian \(K\) is
\begin{equation}
    X_K = K R_\alpha + \fromDual{\alpha}(\dd{K} - \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}})\,\alpha).
    \label{eq:contact_ham_vf_cofree}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Coordinate expression} Given the contact manifold \((M, \xi)\) with contact form
\begin{equation}
     \dd{q^0} - \sum_{i = 1}^n p_i\dd{q^i},
\end{equation}
and define the contact Hamiltonian \(K = K(q^0, q^1, \ldots, q^n,\, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\). 
The vertical component of the Hamiltonian vector field is straightforward (cf. \cref{eq:reeb_vf}): 
\begin{equation}
     X_K^\text{ver} = -K\pdv{}{q^0}.
\end{equation}
For the horizontal component, first evaluate the right hand side of \cref{eq:basic_form} in coordinates:
\begin{equation}
     \intpr{X_K^\text{hor}}{\dd{\alpha}} =  \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{K}{q^i} + p_i \pdv{K}{q^0})\dd{q^i} + \pdv{K}{p_i}\dd{p^i}.
\end{equation}
In terms of the basis vectors, the mapping \(\toDual{\alpha}\) is
\begin{equation}
     \pdv{}{q^i} \mapsto \dd{p_i} \qquad \pdv{}{p_i} \mapsto -\dd{q^i} \qquad \pdv{}{q^0} \mapsto 0 \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n.
\end{equation}
The inverse transformation is slightly ambiguous at first sight, since any \(\pdv{}{q^0}\) cannot be recovered directly from the `forward' mapping. However, we know that \(\fromDual{\alpha}\) must produce a horizontal vector field. Therefore, first perform the inverse mapping in the \(q^i, p_i\)-components to obtain
\begin{equation}
     - \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{K}{q^i} + p_i \pdv{K}{q^0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{K}{p_i}\pdv{}{q^i}.
\end{equation}
Contracting this expression with \(\alpha\) produces \(\displaystyle - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i\pdv{K}{p_i} \). Hence, we can use this knowledge to find the actual horizontal component:
\begin{equation}
     X_K^\text{hor} = \sum_{i=1}^n p\pdv{K}{p_i} \pdv{}{q^0}- \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{K}{q^i} + p_i \pdv{K}{q^0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{K}{p_i}\pdv{}{q^i}.
\end{equation}
As such, the coordinate expression of \cref{eq:contact_ham_vf_cofree} is 
\begin{equation}
    X_K = \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\pdv{K}{p_i} - K) \pdv{}{q^0}- \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{K}{q^i} + p_i \pdv{K}{q^0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{K}{p_i}\pdv{}{q^i}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we have
\begin{equation}
     \lied{X_K} \alpha = - \pdv{K}{q^0} \alpha,
\end{equation} 
and 
\begin{equation}
     \lied{X_K} K = - K\pdv{K}{q^0}.
\end{equation} 

%\subsection{Jacobi brackets}
%Just like the Poisson brackets define a Poisson algebra of the smooth functions on a symplectic manifold, there is a bracket operation on contact manifolds that serves (about) the same purpose. These brackets do not define a Poisson structure, but rather a \emph{Jacobi structure}, which is a more general notion that includes the Poisson structure as a particular instance. In this treatment we will only focus on the associated \emph{Jacobi bracket} for contact Hamiltonian systems. For more details regarding Jacobi manifolds, the reader is referred to \cite[chap. V]{Libermann1987} and \cite{DeLeon2020}.
%
%For two smooth functions \(f, g \in \functions{M}\), and \(M\) a contact manifold with contact form \(\alpha\), the \emph{Jacobi bracket} is defined as
%\begin{equation}
%    \jacobi{\:}{}: \functions{M} \times \functions{M} \to \functions{M}:\: \jacobi{f}{g} = -\intpr{\liebr{X_f}{X_g}}{\alpha},
%\end{equation}
%where \(X_f, X_g \in \vfields{M}\) are the contact Hamiltonian vector fields of \(f\) and \(g\) respectively, and \(\liebr{\cdot\,}{\cdot}\) is the Lie bracket (i.e. the commutator of vector fields). Equivalent expressions for the Jacobi bracket are: \cite{Libermann1987}
%\begin{equation}
%    \begin{split}
%        \jacobi{f}{g} =& -\intpr{X_f}{\dd{g}} + g(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{f}}) \\
%                      =& \, \intpr{X_g}{\dd{f}} - f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{g}}) \\
%                      =& -\dd{\alpha}(X_f, X_g) - f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{g}}) + g(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{f}}).\\
%    \end{split}
%\end{equation}
%From these expressions, it is also clear that the Jacobi bracket is antisymmetric, i.e. \(\jacobi{f}{g} = - \jacobi{g}{f}\) and \(\jacobi{f}{f} = 0\). As a time evolution operator (with respect to the Hamiltonian \(K\)), we have
%\begin{equation}
%     \dv{f}{t} = \jacobi{f}{K} + f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{K}}) = \jacobi{f}{K} - fs.
%\end{equation}
%
%Using the same coordinates as in \cref{ssec:contact_ham_vfields}, the Jacobi bracket is equal to:
%\begin{equation}
%     \jacobi{f}{g} = \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pdv{g}{p_i} - g)\pdv{f}{q^0} - \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pdv{f}{p_i} - f)\pdv{g}{q^0} 
%    + \sum_{i=1}^n\qty(\pdv{f}{q^i}\pdv{g}{p_i} - \pdv{g}{q^i}\pdv{f}{p_i}).
%\end{equation}
%
