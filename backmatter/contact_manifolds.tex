\chapter{Contact geometry}
\label{app:contact_geometry}
This appendix provides a short introduction to the basic concepts of contact geometry that are relevant in this thesis, particularly \cref{chap:contact_mechanics}.

%Contact manifolds are odd-dimensional manifolds with the addition of a contact structure. This contact structure can be considered to be like a symplectic structure (which is necessarily even-dimensional) with the addition of one `special' dimension. The relation between contact structures and symplectic structures is crucial for the extension of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to contact manifolds.
\section{Contact structures}
\label{sec:contact_structures}
A \emph{contact element} on a manifold $M$ is a point $m \in M$ combined with a tangent hyperplane $\xi_m \subset \tspace{m}{M}$ (a subspace of the tangent space  with codimension 1). The term `contact' refers to the intuitive notion that if two submanifolds `touch', they share a contact element: they are \emph{in contact} (which is a slightly weaker condition than tangency). \cite{Cannas2001} For example, contact elements to a two-dimensional manifold are simply lines through the origin in the tangent space, contact elements on a three-dimensional manifold are planes through the origin, etc.

A \emph{contact manifold} is a manifold $M$ (of dimension $2n+1$) with a \emph{contact structure}, which is a smooth field (or distribution) of contact elements on $M$. Locally, any contact element determines a 1-form $\alpha$ (up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar) whose kernel constitutes the tangent hyperplane distribution, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \xi_m = \ker \alpha_m
    \label{eq:contact_form}
\end{equation}
This $\alpha$ is called the (local) \emph{contact form}, and it acts like a `normal (co-)vector' to the hyperplane. For the field hyperplanes to be a constact structure, it must satisfy a nondegeneracy condition: it should be \emph{nonintegrable}. This can be expressed as the the Frobenius condition for nonintegrability: \cite{Cannas2001,Abraham1978,Arnold1989}
$$ \wedgep{\alpha}{(\dd{\alpha})^n} \neq 0, $$
where integrable distributions would have this expression vanish everywhere. Roughly equivalent statements are that (i) one cannot find foliations of $M$ such that the $\xi$ is everywhere tangent to it, or (ii) that $\dd{\alpha}\vert_\xi$ is a \emph{symplectic form}. In this treatment, all contact forms are assumed to be global, which is the case if the quotient $TM/\xi$ is a trivial line bundle, i.e. the orientation is preserved across the entire manifold \cite{Geiges2008}.

The \emph{Darboux theorem} for contact manifolds states that it is always possible to find coordinates $z, x_i, y_i$ such that locally, the contact form is equal to 
$$ \dd{z} - \sum y_i\dd{x_i}, $$
which is also called the standard or natural contact structure. The standard contact structure on $\real^3$ is illustrated in \cref{fig:standard_contact}.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \input{media/tikz/standard_contact}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The standard contact structure on $\real^3$, given by the contact form $\dd{z} - y\dd{x}$; the hyperplanes tilt more in the increasing $y$-direction.}
    \label{fig:standard_contact}
\end{figure}
Finally, it is clear that the contact form singles out a `special direction' in the tangent space at every point of the manifold. This direction is given by the unique \emph{Reeb vector field},
\begin{equation}
    R_\alpha \in \vfields{M}:\quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}= 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} = 1. 
    \label{eq:reeb_vf}
\end{equation}
The special direction identified by the Reeb vector field is referred to as the \emph{vertical} direction. Likewise, vector field components in the direction of the Reeb vector field are vertical. A vector field with no vertical component is called \emph{horizontal}.

\section{The manifold of contact elements}
\label{ssec:mfd_contact_elements}
A contact manifold is a manifold with a contact structure. One can, however, associate a \emph{canonical} $(2n-1)$-dimensional contact manifold to \emph{any} $n$-dimensional manifold $Q$, just like one can always find a canonical symplectic structure on $\ctbundle{Q}$. Roughly speaking, this attaches a fiber containing all possible contact elements to every point of the manifold $Q$. As it turns out, this `manifold of contact elements' has a natural contact structure.

The \emph{manifold of contact elements} of an $n$-dimensional manifold is \cite{Cannas2001}
$$ \cbundle{Q} = \qty{(q, \xi_q) \mid q \in Q \text{ and } \xi_q \text{ a hyperplane on } \tspace{q}{Q}}. $$
This manifold $\cbundle{Q}$ has dimension $2n - 1$. It is clear that $C$ has a natural bundle structure, i.e. $\bundle{C}{\pi}{Q}$ where the bundle projection `forgets' the contact element, that is
$$ \pi: \cbundle{Q} \to {Q}: (q, \xi_q) \mapsto q.$$
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \begin{center}
        \input{media/tikz/contact_element}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A point in the manifold of contact elements on $Q = \real^2$. A coordinate system for $\cbundle{Q}$ consists of $(x_0, x_1)$ to indicate a point on $Q$, and projective coordinates $[\eta_0:\eta_1]$, which denote the contact element at that point. Without loss of generalization, one can choose $\eta_0 = 1$, and the remaining coordinate $\eta_1$ covers all but one points in the projective space. A potential confusion rests in this two-dimensional example, since both the `hyperplane` and the equivalence class of 1-forms are both lines in the tangent and cotangent space respectively. This is not the case for higher-dimensions, for which $n - 1 \neq 1$.}
    \label{fig:contact_element}
\end{figure}

There is a convenient way to characterize this manifold of contact elements, for it is isomorphic to the \emph{projectivization of the cotangent bundle} to $Q$, denoted by $\pctbundle{Q}$. This projectivization can be defined in terms of an equivalence relation between two nonzero elements in the cotangent bundle at every point in the manifold:
$$ \vec{\eta},\vec{\chi}\in \ctspace{q}{Q} \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}:\quad (q, \vec{\eta}) \sim (q, \vec{\chi}) \Leftrightarrow \vec{\eta} = \lambda \vec{\chi},\quad \lambda \in \real_0, \text{ for all } q \in Q.$$
This equivalence relations identifies all the covectors in the cotangent space that are a nonzero multiple of each other. It is precisely this identification that takes care of the ambiguity in \cref{eq:contact_form}, in that any nonzero multiple of a 1-form has the same kernel, and therefore gives rise to the same contact structure. $\pctbundle{Q}$ is then the quotient set of $\ctbundle{Q}$ (without zero section) with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$. Visually, the projectivization of an $n$-dimensional vector space is the space of all \emph{lines} through the origin in that vector space, which has dimension $n - 1$. It can be shown that this space is bundle-isomorphic to the manifold $\cbundle{Q}$. \cite{Cannas2001} 

As shown in \cref{fig:contact_element}, coordinates of the equivalence class of 1-forms are `projective coordinates', $[\eta_0\;:\;\eta_1:\ldots :\eta_{n-1}]$, where $\eta_i$ are coordinates for $\ctspace{q}{Q}$. The projective coordinates acknowledge the invariance under multiplication by a nonzero number. If one assumes $\eta_0$ to be nonzero, the tuple $(1, \eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n)$ provides coordinates that cover most of $\pctbundle{Q}$. 

Now, it remains to be explained why the `manifold of contact elements` is itself a contact manifold. Indeed, there is a canonical field of hyperplanes \emph{on} $\cbundle{Q}$, which lifts the hyperplane tangent to $Q$ to a hyperplane tangent to $\cbundle{Q}$ (this is akin to the `tautological' trick played in the symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle). The contact structure distinguishes the curves in $\cbundle{Q}$ that are lifted versions from curves in $Q$. This is illustrated in \cref{fig:contact_lift}. \cite{Burke1985}
Said otherwise, a tangent vector on $\cbundle{Q}$ lies in the hyperplane defined by the contact structure if its projection down on $Q$ lies in the hyperplane on $Q$ defined by the given point on the $\cbundle{Q}$. This contact structure is associated with the 1-form:
$$ \alpha = \dd{x}_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} \eta_i\dd{x}_i,$$
given that the $\eta_0$ is the `special' coordinate wich is chosen to be 1.

The standard contact form is then $\dd{q} - v\dd{t}$. On the left, the curve corresponding to a falling object is shown in $Q$. When this curve is `lifted' to $\cbundle{Q}$, the contact structure imposes that it be locally tangent to the contact structure, or that $v = \dv{q}{t}$. If the vertical direction is projected down onto the $(q-t)$-plane ($\cbundle(Q) \to Q$), the hyperplanes defined by the contact structure are line elements tangent to the trajectory, making $v$ the actual velocity of the curve.}

\section{Contact Hamiltonian systems}
\todo{Introduction}

\subsection{Contact Hamiltonian vector fields}
\label{ssec:contact_ham_vfields}
Just like in the symplectic case, the contact Hamiltonian formalism defines an automorphism between a function on the contact manifold, $H \in \functions{M}$, and an associated `Hamiltonian' vector field $X_H \in \vfields{M}$. While the isomorphism is rather straightforward for symplectic manifolds, the contact counterpart is not so perspicuous: this is the prime reason behind the computational advantage of symplectification, as opposed to performing the calculations directly on the contact manifold.
\paragraph{Coordinate-free derivation} Given a contact manifold $(M, \xi)$ with contact form $\alpha$ (i.e. $\xi \in \ker \alpha$), the tangent bundle $M$ can be decomposed into two subbundles: \cite{Libermann1987,Cannas2001}
$$ \tbundle{M} = \ker \alpha \oplus \ker \dd{\alpha}, $$
where $\oplus$ denotes the Whitney sum. The first subbundle is referred to as the \emph{horizontal} bundle, the second as the \emph{vertical}
 bundle. The vertical subbundle is of rank 1 and its fiber is spanned by the Reeb vector field (cf. \cref{eq:reeb_vf}). As mentioned to in \cref{sec:contact_structures}, \emph{any} vector field $X \in \vfields{M}$ may be decomposed accordingly. This decomposition is unique and given by
\begin{equation}
    X = \underbrace{(\intpr{X}{\alpha})R_\alpha}_{X^\text{ver}} + \underbrace{\qty[X - (\intpr{X}{\alpha})R_\alpha]}_{X^\text{hor}}.
    \label{eq:contact_vf_decomp}
\end{equation}
Observe that indeed $X^\text{ver} \in \ker \dd{\alpha}$ and $X^\text{hor} \in \ker \alpha$. \cite{Cannas2001,DeLeon2020,Libermann1987}

We now wish to find the relation between the contact Hamiltonian $H \in \functions{M}$ and the associated Hamiltonian vector field $X_H \in \vfields{M}$. This one-to-one relation is uniquely determined by two conditions. Firstly, we impose that\footnote{This is the sign convention observed by \citet{Bravetti2017} en \citet{VanderSchaft2021}, as opposed to \citet{Libermann1987}.}
    $$ H \equiv -\intpr{X_H}{\alpha}. $$
This condition already provides us with the vertical component of the Hamiltonian vector field, namely
$$ X_H^\text{ver} = -H R_\alpha. $$

Secondly, the automorphism generated by the Hamiltonian vector field must be a \emph{contact automorphism}: it must preserve the contact structure. This condition is encoded in terms of the Lie derivative:\footnote
{Terminology differs somewhat in literature on this point: some authors, such as \citet{DeLeon2020} only refer to contactomorphisms as the special case where $g = 0$; while the more general case is called \emph{conformal} contactomorphisms.}
$$ X_H \text{ is an infinitesimal contact automorphism} \Leftrightarrow \lied{X_H}{\alpha} = s\alpha, $$
where $s \in \functions{M}$. The function $s$ is there because $s \alpha $ and $\alpha$ give rise to the same hyperplane distribution. 
Using Cartan's `magic' formula, the Lie derivative can be expanded as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \lied{X_H}{\alpha} &= s \alpha\\
        \dd{\qty(\intpr{X_H}{\alpha})} + \intpr{X_H}{\dd{\alpha}} &= s\alpha \\
        -\dd{H} + \intpr{X_H}{\dd{\alpha}} &= s\alpha \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Contracting both sides with the Reeb vector field yields:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \intpr{R_\alpha}{\qty(-\dd{H} + \intpr{X_H}{\dd{\alpha}})} &= \intpr{R_\alpha}{\qty(s\alpha)} \\
        -\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}} + \intpr{R_\alpha}{\intpr{X_H}{\dd{\alpha}}} &= s\,\intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} \\
        -\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}} - \intpr{X_H}{\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}} &= s.
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Hence, we have $s = -R_\alpha(\dd{H})$. Because the vertical component of $X_H$ is spanned by the Reeb vector field, its contraction with $\dd{\alpha}$ vanishes. As a result, we can rewrite the previous expression in terms of the \emph{horizontal} component of $X_H$:
\begin{equation}
    \intpr{X_H}{\dd{\alpha}} = \intpr{X_H^\text{hor}}{\dd{\alpha}}=  \qty[\dd{H} - \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}})\alpha], 
    \label{eq:basic_form}
\end{equation}
We must therefore recover $X^\text{hor}_H$ from the above expression. Define the mapping  
$$ \toDual{\alpha}: \tbundle{M} \to \ctbundle{M}: X \mapsto  \intpr{X}{\dd{\alpha}},$$
when restricted to the space of horizontal vector fields, this mapping is an isomorphism onto the `semi-basic' forms\footnote{Semi-basic forms are forms that vanish when contracted with a vertical vector field. \cite{Libermann1987}}. Define the inverse mapping of $\toDual{\alpha}$ by $\fromDual{\alpha}$, such that
$$ X_H^\text{hor} = \fromDual{\alpha}\qty(\dd{H} - \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}})\,\alpha). $$
As such, the Hamiltonian vector field associated to the contact Hamiltonian $H$ is
\begin{equation}
    X_H = H R_\alpha + \fromDual{\alpha}(-\dd{H} + \qty(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}})\,\alpha).
    \label{eq:contact_ham_vf_cofree}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Coordinate expression} Given the contact manifold $(M, \xi)$ with contact form
$$ \dd{q_0} - \sum_{i = 1}^n p_i\dd{q_i}, $$
and define the contact Hamiltonian $H = H(q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n, p_1, \ldots, p_n)$. 
The vertical component of the Hamiltonian vector field is straightforward (cf. \cref{eq:reeb_vf}): 
$$ X_H^\text{ver} = -H\pdv{}{q_0}. $$
For the horizontal component, first evaluate the right hand side of \cref{eq:basic_form} in coordinates:
$$ \intpr{X_H^\text{hor}}{\dd{\alpha}} =  \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{H}{q_i} + p_i \pdv{H}{q_0})\dd{q_i} + \pdv{H}{p_i}\dd{p_i}. $$
In terms of the basis vectors, the mapping $\toDual{\alpha}$ is
$$ \pdv{}{q_i} \mapsto \dd{p_i} \qquad \pdv{}{p_i} \mapsto -\dd{q_i} \qquad \pdv{}{q_0} \mapsto 0 \qquad i = 1, \ldots, n.$$
The inverse transformation is slightly ambiguous at first sight, since any $\pdv{}{q_0}$ cannot be recovered directly from the `forward' mapping. However, we know that $\fromDual{\alpha}$ must produce a horizontal vector field. Therefore, first perform the inverse mapping in the $q_i, p_i$-components to obtain
$$ - \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{H}{q_i} + p_i \pdv{H}{q_0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{H}{p_i}\pdv{}{q_i}. $$
Contracting this expression with $\alpha$ produces $ - \sum_{i=1}^n p\pdv{H}{p_i} $. Hence, we can use this knowledge to find the actual horizontal component:
$$ X_H^\text{hor} = \sum_{i=1}^n p\pdv{H}{p_i} \pdv{}{q_0}- \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{H}{q_i} + p_i \pdv{H}{q_0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{H}{p_i}\pdv{}{q_i}. $$
As such, the coordinate expression of \cref{eq:contact_ham_vf_cofree} is 
\begin{equation}
    X_H = \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p\pdv{H}{p_i} - H) \pdv{}{q_0}- \sum_{i = 1}^n \qty(\pdv{H}{q_i} + p_i \pdv{H}{q_0})\pdv{}{p_i} + \sum_{i=1}^n \pdv{H}{p_i}\pdv{}{q_i}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, we have
$$ \lied{X_H} \alpha = - \pdv{H}{q_0} \alpha, $$ 
and 
$$ \lied{X_H} H = - H\pdv{H}{q_0}.  $$ 

\subsection{Jacobi brackets}
Just like the Poisson brackets define a Poisson algebra of the smooth functions on a symplectic manifold, there is a bracket operation on contact manifolds that serves (about) the same purpose. These brackets do not define a Poisson structure, but rather a \emph{Jacobi structure}, which is a more general notion that includes the Poisson structure as a particular instance. In this treatment we will only focus on the associated \emph{Jacobi bracket} for contact Hamiltonian systems. For more details regarding Jacobi manifolds, the reader is referred to \cite[chap. V]{Libermann1987} and \cite{DeLeon2020}.

For two smooth functions $f, g \in \functions{M}$, and $M$ a contact manifold with contact form $\alpha$, the \emph{Jacobi bracket} is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \jacobi{\:}{}: \functions{M} \times \functions{M} \to \functions{M}:\: \jacobi{f}{g} = -\intpr{\liebr{X_f}{X_g}}{\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $X_f, X_g \in \vfields{M}$ are the contact Hamiltonian vector fields of $f$ and $g$ respectively, and $\liebr{\cdot\,}{\cdot}$ is the Lie bracket (i.e. the commutator of vector fields). Equivalent expressions for the Jacobi bracket are: \cite{Libermann1987}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \jacobi{f}{g} =& -\intpr{X_f}{\dd{g}} + g(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{f}}) \\
                      =& \, \intpr{X_g}{\dd{f}} - f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{g}}) \\
                      =& -\dd{\alpha}(X_f, X_g) - f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{g}}) + g(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{f}}).\\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
From these expressions, it is also clear that the Jacobi bracket is antisymmetric, i.e. $\jacobi{f}{g} = - \jacobi{g}{f}$ and $\jacobi{f}{f} = 0$. As a time evolution operator (with respect to the Hamiltonian $H$), we have
$$ \dv{f}{t} = \jacobi{f}{H} + f(\intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{H}}) = \jacobi{f}{H} - fs. $$

Using the same coordinates as in \cref{ssec:contact_ham_vfields}, the Jacobi bracket is equal to:
$$ 
    \jacobi{f}{g} = \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pdv{g}{p_i} - g)\pdv{f}{q_0} - \qty(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pdv{f}{p_i} - f)\pdv{g}{q_0} 
    + \sum_{i=1}^n\qty(\pdv{f}{q_i}\pdv{g}{p_i} - \pdv{g}{q_i}\pdv{f}{p_i}).
$$
