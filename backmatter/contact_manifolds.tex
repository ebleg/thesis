\chapter{Contact geometry}
This appendix provides a short introduction to the basic concepts of contact geometry that are relevant in this thesis, particularly \cref{chap:contact_mechanics}.

%Contact manifolds are odd-dimensional manifolds with the addition of a contact structure. This contact structure can be considered to be like a symplectic structure (which is necessarily even-dimensional) with the addition of one `special' dimension. The relation between contact structures and symplectic structures is crucial for the extension of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics to contact manifolds.
\section{Contact structures}
A \emph{contact element} on a manifold $M$ is a point $m \in M$ combined with a tangent hyperplane $\xi_m \subset \tspace{m}{M}$ (a subspace of the tangent space  with codimension 1). The term `contact' refers to the intuitive notion that if two submanifolds `touch', they share a contact element: they are \emph{in contact} (which is a slightly weaker condition than tangency). \cite{Cannas2001} For example, contact elements to a two-dimensional manifold are simply lines through the origin in the tangent space, contact elements on a three-dimensional manifold are planes through the origin, etc.

A \emph{contact manifold} is a manifold $M$ (of dimension $2n+1$) with a \emph{contact structure}, which is a smooth field (or distribution) of contact elements on $M$. Locally, any contact element determines a 1-form $\alpha$ (up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar) whose kernel constitutes the tangent hyperplane distribution, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
    \xi_m = \ker \alpha_m
    \label{eq:contact_form}
\end{equation}
This $\alpha$ is called the (local) \emph{contact form}, and it acts like a `normal (co-)vector' to the hyperplane. For the field hyperplanes to be a constact structure, it must satisfy a nondegeneracy condition: it should be \emph{nonintegrable}. This can be expressed as the the Frobenius condition for nonintegrability: \cite{Cannas2001,Abraham1978,Arnold1989}
$$ \wedgep{\alpha}{(\dd{\alpha})^n} \neq 0, $$
where integrable distributions would have this expression vanish everywhere. Roughly equivalent statements are that (i) one cannot find foliations of $M$ such that the $\xi$ is everywhere tangent to it, or (ii) that $\dd{\alpha}\vert_\xi$ is a \emph{symplectic form}. In this treatment, all contact forms are assumed to be global, which is the case if the quotient $TM/\xi$ is a trivial line bundle, i.e. the orientation is preserved across the entire manifold \cite{Geiges2008}.

The \emph{Darboux theorem} for contact manifolds states that it is always possible to find coordinates $z, x_i, y_i$ such that locally, the contact form is equal to 
$$ \dd{z} - \sum y_i\dd{x_i}, $$
which is also called the standard or natural contact structure. The standard contact structure on $\real^3$ is illustrated in \cref{fig:standard_contact}.

    \label{fig:standard_contact}
\end{figure}
Finally, it is clear that the contact form singles out a `special direction' in the tangent space at every point of the manifold. This direction is given by the unique \emph{Reeb vector field},
$$ R_\alpha \in \vfields{M}:\quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\dd{\alpha}}= 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \intpr{R_\alpha}{\alpha} = 1,$$
that is, it locally points in the `direction' of the contact form.

\section{The manifold of contact elements}
\label{ssec:mfd_contact_elements}
A contact manifold is a manifold with a contact structure. One can, however, associate a \emph{canonical} $(2n-1)$-dimensional contact manifold to \emph{any} $n$-dimensional manifold $Q$, just like one can always find a canonical symplectic structure on $\ctbundle{Q}$. Roughly speaking, this attaches a fiber containing all possible contact elements to every point of the manifold $Q$. As it turns out, this `manifold of contact elements' has a natural contact structure.

The \emph{manifold of contact elements} of an $n$-dimensional manifold is \cite{Cannas2001}
$$ \cbundle{Q} = \qty{(q, \xi_q) \mid q \in Q \text{ and } \xi_q \text{ a hyperplane on } \tspace{q}{Q}}. $$
This manifold $\cbundle{Q}$ has dimension $2n - 1$. It is clear that $C$ has a natural bundle structure, i.e. $\bundle{C}{\pi}{Q}$ where the bundle projection `forgets' the contact element, that is
$$ \pi: \cbundle{Q} \to {Q}: (q, \xi_q) \mapsto q.$$
\begin{figure}[h!]

        \input{media/tikz/contact_element}

    \caption{A point in the manifold of contact elements on $Q = \real^2$. A coordinate system for $\cbundle{Q}$ consists of $(x_0, x_1)$ to indicate a point on $Q$, and projective coordinates $[\eta_0:\eta_1]$, which denote the contact element at that point. Without loss of generalization, one can choose $\eta_0 = 1$, and the remaining coordinate $\eta_1$ covers all but one points in the projective space. A potential confusion rests in this two-dimensional example, since both the `hyperplane` and the equivalence class of 1-forms are both lines in the tangent and cotangent space respectively. This is not the case for higher-dimensions, for which $n - 1 \neq 1$.}
    \label{fig:contact_element}
\end{figure}

There is a convenient way to characterize this manifold of contact elements, for it is isomorphic to the \emph{projectivization of the cotangent bundle} to $Q$, denoted by $\pctbundle{Q}$. This projectivization can be defined in terms of an equivalence relation between two nonzero elements in the cotangent bundle at every point in the manifold:
$$ \vec{\eta},\vec{\chi}\in \ctspace{q}{Q} \setminus \{\mathbf{0}\}:\quad (q, \vec{\eta}) \sim (q, \vec{\chi}) \Leftrightarrow \vec{\eta} = \lambda \vec{\chi},\quad \lambda \in \real_0, \text{ for all } q \in Q.$$
This equivalence relations identifies all the covectors in the cotangent space that are a nonzero multiple of each other. It is precisely this identification that takes care of the ambiguity in \cref{eq:contact_form}, in that any nonzero multiple of a 1-form has the same kernel, and therefore gives rise to the same contact structure. $\pctbundle{Q}$ is then the quotient set of $\ctbundle{Q}$ (without zero section) with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$. Visually, the projectivization of an $n$-dimensional vector space is the space of all \emph{lines} through the origin in that vector space, which has dimension $n - 1$. It can be shown that this space is bundle-isomorphic to the manifold $\cbundle{Q}$. \cite{Cannas2001} 

As shown in \cref{fig:contact_element}, coordinates of the equivalence class of 1-forms are `projective coordinates', $[\eta_0\;:\;\eta_1:\ldots :\eta_{n-1}]$, where $\eta_i$ are coordinates for $\ctspace{q}{Q}$. The projective coordinates acknowledge the invariance under multiplication by a nonzero number. If one assumes $\eta_0$ to be nonzero, the tuple $(1, \eta_1, \ldots, \eta_n)$ provides coordinates that cover most of $\pctbundle{Q}$. 

Now, it remains to be explained why the `manifold of contact elements` is itself a contact manifold. Indeed, there is a canonical field of hyperplanes \emph{on} $\cbundle{Q}$, which lifts the hyperplane tangent to $Q$ to a hyperplane tangent to $\cbundle{Q}$ (this is akin to the `tautological' trick played in the symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle). The contact structure distinguishes the curves in $\cbundle{Q}$ that are lifted versions from curves in $Q$. This is illustrated in \cref{fig:contact_lift}. \cite{Burke1985}
Said otherwise, a tangent vector on $\cbundle{Q}$ lies in the hyperplane defined by the contact structure if its projection down on $Q$ lies in the hyperplane on $Q$ defined by the given point on the $\cbundle{Q}$. This contact structure is associated with the 1-form:
$$ \alpha = \dd{x}_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n-1} \eta_i\dd{x}_i,$$
given that the $\eta_0$ is the `special' coordinate wich is chosen to be 1.

    \caption{Intuitive picture of the canonical contact on the manifold of contact elements. In this case, let $ (t, q) \in Q$, and let $v$ be a coordinate for the contact (line) element. The standard contact form is then $\dd{q} - v\dd{t}$. On the left, the curve corresponding to a falling object is shown in $Q$. When this curve is `lifted' to $\cbundle{Q}$, the contact structure imposes that it be locally tangent to the contact structure, or that $v = \dv{q}{t}$. If the vertical direction is projected down onto the $(q-t)$-plane ($\cbundle(Q) \to Q$), the hyperplanes defined by the contact structure are line elements tangent to the trajectory, making $v$ the actual velocity of the curve.}

\textbf{Zoo of structures in literature}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cosymplectic = structure on odd-dimensional manifold, closed 2-form $\omega$ and closed 1-form $\eta$, with $\wedgep{\eta}{\omega^n} \neq 0$. 
    \item Presymplectic = structure on an even-dimensional manifold, rank of 2-form not maximal but at least constant.
    \item Precontact system = odd-dimensional extension of presymplectic.
