In eight modules, the book provides frameworks for both theory and practice. It first explores the economic justification and history of Credit Scoring, risk linkages and decision science, statistical and mathematical tools, the assessment of business enterprises, and regulatory issues ranging from data privacy to Basel II. It then provides a practical how-to-guide for scorecard development, including data collection, scorecard implementation, and use within the credit risk management cycle. Including numerous real-life examples and an extensive glossary and bibliography, the text assumes little prior knowledge making it an indispensable desktop reference for graduate students in statistics, business, economics and finance, MBA students, credit risk and financial practitioners.},

Leading researchers from varied communities, including economists, sociologists, financial analysts, mathematicians, physicists, statisticians, and others, report on their recent work, discuss topical issues, and review the relevant contemporary literature. A society can be described as a group of people who inhabit the same geographical or social territory and are mutually involved through their shared participation in different aspects of life. It is possible to observe and characterize average behaviors of members of a society, an example being voting behavior. Moreover, the dynamic nature of interaction within any economic sector comprising numerous cooperatively interacting agents has many features in common with the interacting systems of statistical physics. It is on these bases that interest has grown in the application within sociology and economics of the tools of statistical mechanics. This book will be of value for all with an interest in this flourishing field.},

  abstract = {The classical free motion of a mass point on a compact surface of constant negative curvature is the most chaotic possible. The quantal description of this motion is under development. In this review we (a) bring together the mathematical tools needed for the problem; (b) survey the classical results; (c) develop the quantal description; (d) discuss the relations between the classical and quantal results; (e) offer some conjectures towards the diagnosis of chaoticity in quantum systems. The text is divided into chapters and sections; each section ends with a brief summary which also serves as a local abstract. Chapter I gives the motivations. Chapter II describes various models of the pseudosphere, or Bolyai-Lobachevsky plane. Chapters III and IV analyse the classical motions constrained to surfaces of constant negative curvature, and the salient results on ergodicity, mixing, etc.... Chapters V and VI specify the quantum problem and exhibit the relevant mathematical tools. Chapter VII exhibits the remarkable exact connections between the classical and quantal results which are embodied in Selberg's trace formula or are consequences of it. Chapter VIII deals with the semiclassical connections between the two descriptions, including the quantal equivalents of such classical notions as the Liapunov exponent and the Poincar\'e section map. Chapter IX contains some numerical results obtained by C. Schmit on the spectrum of a simple case, in particular on its fluctuations and their interpretation. Chapter X summaries our conclusions. The Appendices from A to N are integral parts of the review and are only separated from the text in order not to interrupt the flow. They contain details which clarify mathematical or conceptual points. Similarly, the figures should also be used to complement and clarify the text. \textcopyright{} 1986.},

When regarded as independent, the variables qi,pi (i = 0, ..., n) define a space double-struck T having a canonical symplectic structure where they appear as conjugate. A thermodynamic system is represented by a n + 1-dimensional gauge-invariant Lagrangian submanifold double-struck M of double-struck T. Any thermodynamic process, even dissipative, taking place on double-struck M is represented by a Hamiltonian trajectory in double-struck T, governed by a Hamiltonian function which is zero on double-struck M. A mapping between the equations of state of different systems is likewise represented by a canonical transformation in double-struck T. Moreover a Riemannian metric arises naturally from statistical mechanics for any thermodynamic system, with the differentials dqi as contravariant components of an infinitesimal shift and the dpi's as covariant ones. Illustrative examples are given.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, engineering systems are becoming increasingly complex and, for design purposes, must be considered as multidisciplinary systems made up of components from different engineering disciplines. With regard to the systematic development and the analysis of models, interdisciplinary methodologies supported by software become more and more important. Bond graphs are a graphical description formalism particularly suited for multidisciplinary systems and used by modellers across the world. Bond Graph Methodology gives a comprehensive, in-depth representation of the state of the art, including recent results gathered from research articles, dissertations and contributions by the author on a number of topics. The structured and rigorous presentation systematically covers model development, analysis of models, numerical computation of models and modern software that can be used for a bond graph approach. The book also includes a range of case studies illustrating various applications of the methodology and provides a glossary. Bond Graph Methodology addresses fundamentals, as well as advanced topics, e.g., models of variable structure, bond graphs for sensitivity analysis and generation of equations for the study of robustness. The compilation and presentation of the material has been inspired by the author's extensive experience in research and teaching. A useful text for advanced courses in modelling, simulation and control, Bond Graph Methodology can also be used for self-study. It has been designed to serve readers interested in the subject of bond graph modelling and those with expertise in related areas, as well as members of the worldwide community of bond graph modellers. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.},

In this work we analyse several unaddressed aspects about the application of contact and metric geometry to thermodynamics. We consider here the Thermodynamic Phase Space and start by investigating the role of gauge transformations and Legendre symmetries for metric contact manifolds and their significance in thermodynamics. Then we present a novel mathematical characterization of first order phase transitions as equilibrium processes on the Thermodynamic Phase Space for which the Legendre symmetry is broken. Moreover, we use contact Hamiltonian dynamics to represent thermodynamic processes in a way that resembles the classical Hamiltonian formulation of conservative mechanics and we show that the relevant Hamiltonian coincides with the irreversible entropy production along thermodynamic processes. Therefore, we use such property to give a geometric definition of thermodynamically admissible fluctuations according to the Second Law of thermodynamics. Finally, we show that the length of a curve describing a thermodynamic process measures its entropy production.},

We illustrate the important role the Liouville formulation has in distinguishing between open loop and feedback control. Mathematical results involving controllability and optimization are discussed along with a theorem establishing the controllability of multiple moments associated with linear models. The methods used succeed by relating the behavior of the solutions of the Liouville equation to the behavior of the underlying ordinary differential equation, the related stochastic differential equation, and the consideration of the related moment equations. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In particular, quantum theories characterized by complex Hamiltonians invariant under spacetime reflection are shown to be equivalent to certain coquaternionic extensions of Hermitian quantum theories. One of the interesting consequences is that the spacetime dimension of these systems is six, not four, on account of the structures of coquaternionic quantum mechanics. \textcopyright{} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the recent physicists' interest in contact geometry, this review paper is devoted to some modern geometric insights upon the contact structures. In view of this, we start from the initial perspective on contact manifolds, namely that of an odd-dimensional orientable manifold whose volume form is generated by a 1-form \texttheta{} and its differential d\texttheta. This naturally arises from a coorientable maximally non-integrable hyperplane distribution. In this picture, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the transitive Jacobi pairs over odd-dimensional manifolds and the coorientable contact structures over the same manifolds. Then, we introduce the geometric perspective on contact manifolds by omitting the coorientability of the maximally non-integrable hyperplane distribution, and we define the contact structure via an L-valued 1-form [with (L, {$\pi$}, M) a line bundle over an odd-dimensional manifold] with non-degenerate curvature. In this realm, it is shown that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the transitive Jacobi line bundles over odd-dimensional manifolds and the contact structures over the same manifolds. This faithful 'representation' of contact structures brings them nearer to symplectic-like ones through the canonical [bracket] structures inherited from the corresponding Jacobi structures.},

  abstract = {Two dramatically different philosophical approaches to classical mechanics were developed during the 17th - 18 th centuries. Newton developed his vectorial formulation that uses time-dependent differential equations of motion to relate vector observables like force and rate of change of momentum. Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, and Jacobi, developed powerful alternative variational formulations based on the assumption that nature follows the principle of least action. These powerful variational formulations have become the preeminent philosophical approach used in modern science, was well as having applications to other fields such as economics and engineering. This book introduces variational principles, and illustrates the intellectual beauty, the remarkable power, and the broad scope, of applying variational principles to classical mechanics. A brief review of Newtonian mechanics compares and contrasts the relative merits of the intuitive Newtonian vectorial formulation, with the more powerful analytical variational formulations. Applications presented cover a wide variety of topics, as well as extensions to accommodate relativistic mechanics, and quantum theory.},

  abstract = {Univariate and multivariate normal probability distributions are widely used when modeling decisions under uncertainty. Computing the performance of such models requires integrating these distributions over specific domains, which can vary widely across models. Besides some special cases where these integrals are easy to calculate, there exist no general analytical expressions, standard numerical methods, or software for these integrals. Here we present mathematical results and open-source software that provide (a) the probability in any domain of a normal in any dimensions with any parameters; (b) the probability density, cumulative distribution, and inverse cumulative distribution of any function of a normal vector; (c) the classification errors among any number of normal distributions, the Bayes-optimal discriminability index, and relation to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC); (d) dimension reduction and visualizations for such problems; and (e) tests for how reliably these methods may be used on given data. We demonstrate these tools with vision research applications of detecting occluding objects in natural scenes and detecting camouflage.},

  abstract = {The relations between various treatments of the classical linearly damped harmonic oscillator and its quantizatlon are investigated. In the course of a historical survey typical features of the problem are discussed on the basis of Havas' classical Hamiltonian and the quantum mechanical S\"ussmann\textemdash Hasse\textemdash Albrecht models as coined by the M\"unchen'Garching nuclear physics group. It is then shown how by imposing a restriction on the classical trajectories in order to connect the Hamiltonian with the energy, the time-independent Bateman\textemdash Morse\textemdash Feshbach\textemdash Bopp Hamiltonian leads to the time-dependent Caldirola\textemdash Kanai Hamiltonian. Canonical quantization of either formulation entails a violation of Heisenbergs principle. By means of a unified treatment of both the electrical and mechanical semi-infinite transmission line, this defect is related to the disregard of additional quantum fluctuations that are intrinsically connected with the dissipation. The difficulties of these models are discussed. Then it is proved that the Bateman dual Hamiltonian is connected to a recently developed comples svmplectic formulation by a simple canonical transformation. The fundamental commutator is still in error. Therefore it is demonstrated how, either separating the dual oscillators according to a modified version of Bopps original treatment or reducing classical comples phase space by an integration over the mirror image subspace. a quantum continuity equation is obtained that leads to Dekker's master equation following the usual operator algebra. The dissipation induces additional fluctuations. The same density operator equation is shown to arise in quantum optics in the weak coupling limit. Nest, for weak friction. Hasse's pure state condition is used to derive an equivalent nonlinear hut normcons4. ing frictional Schrodinger equation. It insolves a particular non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which, if rewritten in terms of Dekker's comples variables, reveals an elegant estension of the classical Hamilton\textemdash Jacobi theory. Finally, this formalism is used to make contact with Kostin's fluid dynamical Schrodinger\textemdash Langevin equation.},

As it is well known, the first structure plays a central role in the theory of time-dependent hamiltonians, whilst the second is here used to treat classical hamiltonians including dissipation terms. The interest of a geometric Hamilton-Jacobi equation is the primordial observation that if a hamiltonian vector field X H can be projected into a configuration manifold by means of a 1-form , then the integral curves of the projected vector field can be transformed into integral curves of X H provided that W is a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this way, we use the geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory to derive solutions of physical systems with a time-dependent hamiltonian formulation or including dissipative terms. Explicit, new expressions for a geometric Hamilton-Jacobi equation are obtained on a cosymplectic and a contact manifold. These equations are later used to solve physical examples containing explicit time dependence, as it is the case of a unidimensional trigonometric system, and two dimensional nonlinear oscillators as Winternitz-Smorodinsky oscillators and for explicit dissipative behavior, we solve the example of a unidimensional damped oscillator.},

For example, the ordinary Hamiltonian method cannot be used when the momenta pr, defined in terms of the Lagrangian function L by the usual formulae pr = {$\partial$}L/{$\partial$}qr, are not independent functions of the velocities. A practical case of this kind is provided by the electromagnetic field, considered as a dynamical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, since the momentum conjugate to the scalar potential at any point vanishes identically. Again, for the very simple example of the relativistic motion of a particle of zero rest-mass in field-free space, the Lagrangian function vanishes and the usual Lagrangian method is not applicable.},

  abstract = {This article is the third of a series of three in which we establish and solve a physical analogy of the economic model underlying mathematical programming. In the third article the concept of equilibrium is de rived from the basic notion of a static mechanical system at rest, and it is shown how, by refining this concept, it can be extended to dynamic physical systems. In this process it is also explained why an extremum value of a state-function determines an equilibrium state of a system. From an economic viewpoint the physical concept of equilibrium is identified with that of a perfectly competi tive market, and it is demonstrated how this concept dif fers from the equilibrium concept of a monopolist. For comparison, industries with one and two outputs are considered. From a mathematical programming viewpoint both linear and quadratic problems are discussed in terms of methods of classical mechanics. In particular it is shown that the simplex method can be derived from Fourier's inequality for equilibrium on a boundary and that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are statements analogous to Kirchhoff's mesh law for an electrical network. \textcopyright{} 1969, Sage Publications.

  abstract = {For the quantum Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian, describing a quantum damped harmonic oscillator, a couple of constant of motion operators generating the Heisenberg algebra can be found. The inclusion in this algebra, in a unitary manner, of the standard time evolution generator i{$\hslash\delta$}/{$\delta$}t, which is not a constant of motion, requires a non-trivial extension of this basic algebra and the physical system itself, which now includes a new dual particle. This enlarged algebra, when exponentiated, leads to a group, named the Bateman group, which admits unitary representations with support in the Hilbert space of functions satisfying the Schr\"odinger equation associated with the quantum Bateman Hamiltonian, either as a second order di\"oerential operator as well as a first order one. The classical Bateman Hamiltonian describes a dual system of a damped (losing energy) particle and a dual (gaining energy) particle. The classical Bateman system has a solution submanifold containing the trajectories of the original system as a submanifold. When restricted to this submanifold, the Bateman dual classical Hamiltonian leads to the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian for a single damped particle. This construction can also be done at the quantum level, and the Caldirola-Kanai Hamiltonian operator can be derived from the Bateman Hamiltonian operator when appropriate constraints are imposed. \textcopyright{} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In order to keep the prerequisites to a minimum, the author restricts attention to matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. This approach keeps the discussion concrete, allows the reader to get to the heart of the subject quickly, and covers all of the most interesting examples. The book also introduces the often-intimidating machinery of roots and the Weyl group in a gradual way, using examples and representation theory as motivation. The text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams. This book is sure to become a standard textbook for graduate students in mathematics and physics with little or no prior exposure to Lie theory.

  abstract = {Alternative definitions of the imaginary unit i other than i 2 = -1 can give rise to interesting and useful complex number systems. The 16th-century Italian mathematicians G. Cardan (1501-1576) and R. Bombelli (1526-1572) are thought to be among the first to utilize the complex numbers we know today by calculating with a quantity whose square is -1. Since then, various people have modified the original definition of the product of complex numbers. The English geometer W. Clifford (1845-1879) developed the "double" complex numbers by requiring that i 2 = 1. Clifford's application of double numbers to mechanics has been supplemented by applications to noneuclidean geometries. The German geometer E. Study (1862-1930) added still another variant to the collection of complex products. The "dual" numbers arose from the convention that i 2 = 0 [11]. Well known in kinematics is the use of dual number methods for the analysis of spatial mechanisms, robotic control, and virtual reality [4, 5, 10]. The ordinary, dual, and double numbers are particular members of a two-parameter family of complex number systems often called binary numbers or generalized complex numbers, which are two-component numbers of the form z = x + iy (x, y {$\in$} R) where i 2 = iq + p (q, p {$\in$} R). It can be shown that generalized complex number systems are isomorphic (as rings) to the ordinary, dual, and double complex numbers when p + q 2 /4 is negative, zero, and positive, respectively (FIGURE 1) [11]. p q ordinary number systems systems double number dual number systems Figure 1 Generalized complex numbers are isomorphic (as rings) to the ordinary, dual, and double numbers.},

  author = {Huisman, L.S.},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Labour market economics has been gaining more and more attention over the years, due to increasing job insecurity. There is a growing demand for the improvement of labour market models. Labour market models are representations of the labour market system used to provide insight to the effects of government policy. Current labour market models have been criticised due to their complexity. Moreover, the models do not provide adequate insight on the relation between the model's assumptions and their outcome. This thesis applies Economic Engineering to the labour market system. The system is modelled using Economic-Engineering analogs and the government is modelled as a controller. The Economic-Engineering methodology adds understanding to the labour market system itself and the performance of the government's policy. This thesis presents both a micro- and macro-scale interpretation of the labour market. It is shown how system characteristics determine the system's response to market shocks. Frequency domain analysis is used to connect the dynamical behaviour on both scales to the system's response. This gives increased insight in the labour market's system dynamics. The government is treated as a controller. A PID- and a robust H{$\infty$}-controller are designed to provide policy advice. The control objective is to minimise the effects of international distur- bances on Dutch unemployment rates. The control input of both controllers is in compliance with current economic theory. It is shown in what sense the PID controller differs from the H{$\infty$}-controller and under which conditions which controller is advisable. This depends on knowledge on the type of uncertainty and disturbances acting on the system.},

  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The Utility Lagrangian and the Surplus Hamiltonian in economic engineering do not depend on consumption. Two theories are proposed to include the effect of consumption in the Utility Lagrangian and the Surplus Hamiltonian. The second of these two theories resolves the dissipation obstacle in port-Hamiltonian systems as an additional result. The first theory includes consumption as a fractional-order derivative in the Fractional Utility Lagrangian, following an action principle for dissipative systems proposed in the literature. The principle of maximal utility from economic engineering results in a fractional Euler- Lagrange equation that relates a change in price to the accrued benefit less the accrued depreciation due to consumption. A Legendre transform of the Fractional Utility Lagrangian results in a Fractional Surplus Hamiltonian the reveals the effect of consumption on surplus. A drawback of this theory is that control formalisms of port-Hamiltonian systems theory cannot be applied to the Fractional Surplus Hamiltonian, since it is not canonical. The second theory includes consumption in the Surplus Hamiltonian with complex state variables and \textemdash in general\textemdash{} dissipation in the Hamiltonian formalism. The theory of Complex Hamiltonians is developed to model damped harmonic oscillators as canonical Hamiltonian systems. The Complex Hamilton's equations result in the equations of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator and are equivalent to the canonical Poisson bracket between the complex state and the Complex Hamiltonian. Applying control formalisms from port-Hamiltonian systems theory to the Complex Hamiltonian bypasses the dissipation obstacle that in real- valued port-Hamiltonian systems stymies the control of dissipative systems. Utilizing the analogies from economic engineering results in a Complex Surplus Hamiltonian. Evaluating the Complex Surplus Hamiltonian shows that the marginal propensity to consume is the economic analog of the damping ratio. Control formalisms from port-Hamiltonian systems can be applied to the Complex Surplus Hamiltonian. As an additional result, it is shown that the fractional derivative can be used as a storage variable for heat generated by frictional dissipation; this results in an expression for dissipated energy},

However, when complex power is considered, there does not seem to exist a similar statement for the imaginary power, either in the timedomain or in the frequency-domain. Recently, in the context of electromagnetic fields, it has been shown by complexifying the time to t+js and interpreting s as reactive time, that it is possible to set up an imaginary power balance in terms of the rate of change of reactive energy in reactive time. Here these ideas are specialized to linear and time-invariant RLC networks. For non-sinusoidal waveforms it is shown that the rate of change of reactive energy in reactive time contains all the essential properties and features of the commonly accepted definition of reactive power under sinusoidal conditions. We believe that this provides an unambiguous and physically motivated resolution to the longstanding debate on how to generalize reactive power to non-sinusoidal waveforms.},

It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, and is indispensable for researchers seeking a self-contained reference on control theory. Unlike most books on the subject, Feedback Systems develops transfer functions through the exponential response of a system, and is accessible across a range of disciplines that utilize feedback in physical, biological, information, and economic systems. Karl \AA str\"om and Richard Murray use techniques from physics, computer science, and operations research to introduce control-oriented modeling. They begin with state space tools for analysis and design, including stability of solutions, Lyapunov functions, reachability, state feedback observability, and estimators. The matrix exponential plays a central role in the analysis of linear control systems, allowing a concise development of many of the key concepts for this class of models. \AA str\"om and Murray then develop and explain tools in the frequency domain, including transfer functions, Nyquist analysis, PID control, frequency domain design, and robustness. They provide exercises at the end of every chapter, and an accompanying electronic solutions manual is available.

  abstract = {This thesis is a first effort to develop a grey-box model of a macroeconomic system. This is in contrast to current black-box modelling approaches. These black-box modelling approaches result in models where the signals and parameters lose their economic interpretation. Com- panies who develop macroeconomic scenario models such as Ortec Finance, have identified this as a major limitation. In this thesis, an engineering approach is taken. Engineers use the laws of physics to develop grey-box models. In economic-engineering [62], economic systems are modelled as causal dynamical systems. The economic engineering theory is based on the analogies between the dynamics of economic phenomena on the one hand and mechanical (and electrical) phenomena on the other hand. By applying the economic-engineering analogies, a structural method is developed that translates the National accounting and the circular flow theory of macroeco- nomics into the laws of physics and engineering concepts. As a test case, this thesis considers the United States economy. The developed method is used to obtain three main results: 1) A bond-graph model for the United States economy. 2) A linear time invariant state-space model derived from the bond-graph model for time domain analysis and 3) The Laplace transformation of the model to perform valuation and analysis in the frequency domain. In the financial industry, the use of the frequency domain for evaluating and modelling economic systems is a relatively new development [86]. This thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of an economic-engineering approach to intuitively use both the time- and frequency domain for macroeconomic scenario modelling. Master},

  author = {Legrand, Emiel Bruno},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Financial instruments are currently interpreted in economic engineering as rotational me- chanical systems. This is motivated by the fact that compound interest can be viewed as a hyperbolic rotation. Hyperbolic rotations, or squeeze mappings, make various appearances in physics and mathematics; notable examples are the theory of special relativity, M\"obius trans- formations and hyperbolic geometry. All of these subjects are related, because the group of M\"obius transformations is isomorphic to the group of restricted Lorentz transformations in special relativity. The Lorentz group is the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane embedded in three-dimensional Lorentz space. The hyperbolic rotations find their application in economic engineering, because continuous reinvestment of earnings leads to a hyperbolic rotation in the capital-yield plane. Unfortu- nately, the financial analogy with rotational dynamics shows some severe inconsistencies when applied to real systems. It is therefore proposed to develop a new interpretation of capital and investments. This approach shall be rooted in the fundamentals of economic engineering based on principles from analytical mechanics.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {The economic engineering group at the DCSC uses Newtonian and analytical mechanics to model economic systems but makes no use of thermodynamics. The introduction of ther- modynamics to the economic engineering framework would increase the extent of analysis and interpretation of economic systems in economic engineering. In this thesis the foun- dations of the thermodynamics of economic engineering are developed in order to include thermodynamic modeling of economic systems in the field of economic engineering. After the development of the thermodynamics of economic engineering theory, the theory is applied to analyze economic growth, factor productivity, and the value of a business. An axiomatic approach is taken to derive economic analogs to thermodynamic concepts. The meaning of an axiomatic approach is that these economic-thermodynamic analogs are developed in a logical order, e.g., the economic analog to temperature is not introduced before developing the economic analog to the first law. Key analogs between economics and thermodynamics are established in this thesis that include but are not limited to two fundamental economic laws, work as an expenditure, heat as an expense, temperature as a price level, entropy as a quantity referred to as human capital in the thesis. By deriving key analogs, the thesis establishes the foundational principles of thermodynamics within economic engineering. Utilizing the theory of the thermodynamics of economic engineering results in applications to economic growth. Empirical growth accounting is modeled by the fundamental thermo- dynamic relationship. A relationship between linear production functions and Cobb-Douglas type production functions is shown by analyzing the productivity of an economy. Further- more, a method to evaluate the worth of a business is created by determining the business' total potential earnings. Additionally, the thesis shares a vision of how to include thermodynamics within a control engineering framework. A higher-dimensional energy-based approach to model dynamical systems offers a way forward to include thermodynamic energy and entropy within control formalisms. Such a framework would account for availability and heat buildup in controlled dynamical systems. One potential application is to account for the heat build up that occurs in integrated circuits.},

  abstract = {Marsden and Scheurle [1993] studied Lagrangian reduction in the context of momentum map constraints--here meaning the reduction of the standard Euler-Lagrange system restricted to a level set of a momentum map. This provides a Lagrangian parallel to the reduction of symplectic manifolds. The present paper studies the Lagrangian parallel of Poisson reduction for Hamiltonian systems. For the reduction of a Lagrangian system on a level set of a conserved quantity, a key object is the Routhian, which is the Lagrangian minus the mechanical connection paired with the fixed value of the momentum map. For unconstrained systems, we use a velocity shifted Lagrangian, which plays the role of the Routhian in the constrained theory. Hamilton's variational principle for the Euler-Lagrange equations breaks up into two sets of equations that represent a set of Euler-Lagrange equations with gyroscopic forcing that can be written in terms of the curvature of the connection for horizontal variations, and into the Euler-Poincar\'e equations for the vertical variations. This new set of equations is what we call the reduced Euler-Lagrange equations, and it includes the Euler-Poincar\'e and the Hamel equations as special cases. We illustrate this methodology for a rigid body with internal rotors and for a particle moving in a magnetic field.},

The theme of the book is to develop the basic theory and applications of mechanics with an emphasis on the role of symmetry. In recent times, the interest in mechanics, and in symmetry techniques in particular, has accelerated because of developments in dynamical systems, the use of geometric methods and new applications to integrable and chaotic systems, control systems, stability and bifurcation, and the study of specific rigid, fluid, plasma and elastic systems. Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry lays the basic foundation for these topics and includes numerous specific applications, making it beneficial to physicists and engineers. This text has specific examples and applications showing how the theory works, and up-to-date techniques, all of which makes it accessible to a wide variety of readers, expecially senior undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, physics and engineering.

This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management and equips readers--whether financial risk analysts, actuaries, regulators, or students of quantitative finance--with practical tools to solve real-world problems. The authors cover methods for market, credit, and operational risk modelling; place standard industry approaches on a more formal footing; and describe recent developments that go beyond, and address main deficiencies of, current practice.The book's methodology draws on diverse quantitative disciplines, from mathematical finance through statistics and econometrics to actuarial mathematics. Main concepts discussed include loss distributions, risk measures, and risk aggregation and allocation principles. A main theme is the need to satisfactorily address extreme outcomes and the dependence of key risk drivers. The techniques required derive from multivariate statistical analysis, financial time series modelling, copulas, and extreme value theory. A more technical chapter addresses credit derivatives. Based on courses taught to masters students and professionals, this book is a unique and fundamental reference that is set to become a standard in the field. \textcopyright{} 2005 by Princeton University Press.

Methods involving approximation theory, differential equations, the matrix eigenvalues, and the matrix characteristic polynomial have been proposed. In practice, consideration of computational stability and efficiency indicates that some of the methods are preferable to others but that none are completely satisfactory. Most of this paper was originally published in 1978. An update, with a separate bibliography, describes a few recent developments.},

The hyperbolic Cauchy-Riemann conditions, hyperbolic derivatives and hyperbolic integrals are introduced on parts 2 and 3. Then special emphasis is given in parts 4 and 5 to conformal hyperbolic transformations which preserve the wave equation, and hyperbolic Riemann surfaces which are naturally associated to classical string motions.},

  author = {Mulder, J J D},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {This thesis develops a method to forecast the cash flows that determine the value of an enterprise. From a control engineers perspective, three stages arise to develop such a method: the research, the system and the control part. The research part presents the results of a control theoretic analysis of PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) valuation methods. The subject of the analysis in this thesis considers an enterprise in the car leasing business. It addresses the fact that current cash flow forecast methods have limitations that can be overcome by using the tools of Systems and control. This part determines that three important agents influence the cash flow of an enterprise: the firm, its management and its consumer. The system part develops an LTI model in such a way that its dynamical behaviour aligns with the behaviour of the firm and its consumer. This part uses bond graphs and the analogies of economic engineering to build a fifth-order mechanical system that corresponds to the firm and its consumer. The system includes the interaction between the firm and its customer in order to determine price, output, and resource allocation decisions. The control part designs two controllers that align with the control actions of management in various market situations. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control as management deals with growth reference signals and unexpected disturbances in future market situations. Furthermore, management strives to maximize profit. This part designs an optimal controller that optimizes energy flows to maximize the profit of an enterprise by analogizing cash flow as energy. The benefit of modeling an enterprise with a control theoretic approach is that the model incorporates high-order effects such as price changes and management decisions, which results in a more realistic representation of reality.},

  abstract = {This thesis develops dynamical state-space models of the oil market and suggests opportunities for the application of control theory. The emphasis of this thesis is on the modelling, rather than the control theory applications. Most models that are currently employed by oil companies do not model short-term tran- sient responses, but focus on long-term equilibrium modelling. Short-term transient response modelling of oil-economic systems can benefit trading and supply activities of oil companies. The models that are provided in this thesis have the ability to model short-term transient responses, due to the their dynamical nature and economic basis. To obtain these models, this thesis uses economic engineering. Economic engineering is a discipline that models economic systems, using an analogy between economic variables and engineering variables. The model development in this thesis consists of three parts. First, a fundamental economic- engineering model is built that represents the global crude-oil market. The model forecasts crude-oil prices using global crude-oil production as an exogenous input. The parameters of this model are estimated using system identification. Second, this thesis provides specialized models for common oil-market phenomena within the economic-engineering framework. These include refinery modelling, geographic dispersion, the futures market and economic growth. Finally, this thesis suggests applications for control theory. For these applications, various controllers are discussed. The identified fundamental model yields positive first results that do no reject the validity of the modelling approach. Moreover, the specialized models provide satisfactory solutions for several oil market mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The geometry of hyperbolic orbits suggests that Minkowskian geometry, and not Euclidean, may provide the most adequate description of the motion. This idea is explored in order to derive a new regularized formulation for propagating arbitrarily perturbed hyperbolic orbits. The mathematical foundations underlying Minkowski space\textendash time \$\$\textbackslash mathbb \{M\}\$\$M are exploited to describe hyperbolic orbits. Hypercomplex numbers are introduced to define the rotations, vectors, and metrics in the problem: the evolution of the eccentricity vector is described on the Minkowski plane R21 in terms of hyperbolic numbers, and the orbital plane is described on the inertial reference using quaternions. A set of eight orbital elements is introduced, namely a time-element, the components of the eccentricity vector in R21, the semimajor axis, and the components of the quaternion defining the orbital plane. The resulting formulation provides a deep insight into the geometry of hyperbolic orbits. The performance of the formulation in long-term propagations is studied. The orbits of four hyperbolic comets are integrated and the accuracy of the solution is compared to other regularized formulations. The resulting formulation improves the stability of the integration process and it is not affected by the perihelion passage. It provides a level of accuracy that may not be reached by the compared formulations, at the cost of increasing the computational time.},

  abstract = {Filtering and smoothing methods are used to produce an accurate estimate of the state of a time-varying system based on multiple observational inputs (data). Interest in these methods has exploded in recent years, with numerous applications emerging in fields such as navigation, aerospace engineering, telecommunications and medicine. This compact, informal introduction for graduate students and advanced undergraduates presents the current state-of-the-art filtering and smoothing methods in a unified Bayesian framework. Readers learn what non-linear Kalman filters and particle filters are, how they are related, and their relative advantages and disadvantages. They also discover how state-of-the-art Bayesian parameter estimation methods can be combined with state-of-the-art filtering and smoothing algorithms. The book's practical and algorithmic approach assumes only modest mathematical prerequisites. Examples include Matlab computations, and the numerous end-of-chapter exercises include computational assignments. Matlab code is available for download at www.cambridge.org/sarkka, promoting hands-on work with the methods.},

It is shown that the generalized transformation leads to true coordinates when the coefficients of the differentials are coordinate- independent; otherwise the transformation generally leads to quasico-ordinates. More general transformations are discussed, the relation with the method of Lagrange multipliers is established, and some problems which arise in connection with quantization are pointed out.},

But more importantly, intuitive explanations, developed and refined through classroom experience with this material, are provided throughout the book. Volume I introduces the fundamental concepts in a discrete-time setting and Volume II builds on this foundation to develop stochastic calculus, martingales, risk-neutral pricing, exotic options, and term structure models, all in continuous time. The book includes a self-contained treatment of the probability theory needed for stochastic calculus, including Brownian motion and its properties. Advanced topics include foreign exchange models, forward measures, and jump-diffusion processes. Classroom-tested exercises conclude every chapter; some of these extend the theory while others are drawn from practical problems in quantitative finance. Instructor's manual available.},

I start with a brief, non-rigorous summary of the basic Arrow-Debreu model of general equilibrium, as well as its extensions to include time and contingency. I then argue that symmetries due to similarly endowed individuals and similar products are generically broken by the constraints of scarcity, leading to the existence of multiple equilibria. This is followed by an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the model generally. Several of the weaknesses are concerned with the treatments of time and contingency. To address these we discuss a class of agent based models. Another set of issues has to do with the fundamental meaning of prices and the related question of what the observables of a non-equilibrium, dynamic model of an economic market should be. We argue that these issues are addressed by formulating economics in the language of a gauge theory, as proposed originally by Malaney and Weinstein. We review some of their work and provide a sketch of how gauge invariance can be incorporated into the formulation of agent based models.},

  abstract = {Time-discounting in behavioural economics is modelled using mechanical system dynamics through the economic engineering framework. The economic engineering framework is being developed at the Delft Center for Systems and Control, and uses mechanical system dynamics to model economic processes and systems. Time-discounting is the calculation of the present value of the received utility from future consumption. Presently behavioural economists have not been able to reach a consensus on how to model time-discounting behaviour. Two theo- ries dominate economic literature: exponential discounting theory and hyperbolic discounting theory. These theories are treated separately by economists and have separate fields of ap- plication. Exponential discounting theory and hyperbolic discounting theory are shown to be related through the dynamics of the damped harmonic oscillator. Exponential and hyperbolic discounting theory are linked to the dynamics of the critically damped and overdamped mechanical system respectively. The dynamics of the underdamped mechanical system are linked to the time-discounting behaviour of a trader. Moreover, the parameters of the damped harmonic oscillator are interpreted economically, resulting in the following analogues: the natural frequency is analogous to the risk-free discount rate, the damping ratio is analogous to time-preference, and the real part of the eigenvalues are anal- ogous to the exponential discount rate. Modelling time-discounting using mechanical system dynamics therefore results in a time-discounting model based on economic first principles. Master},

The dynamics of relativistic systems must be formulated in terms of implicit differential equations in the phase space and not in terms of Hamiltonian vector fields. The constrained Hamiltonian systems introduced by Dirac [1] are not general enough to cover some important cases. We formulate a geometric framework which permits Lagrangian and Hamiltonian descriptions of the dynamics of a wide class of mechanical systems. Lagrangians and Hamiltonians are presented as families of functions. The Legendre transformation and the inverse Legendre transformation are described as transitions between these families. Two examples, the dynamics of a relativistic particle and a space-time formulation of geometric optics (relativistic massless particle), are given.},

It turns out that port-based network models of physical systems immediately lend themselves to a Hamiltonian description. While the usual geometric approach to Hamiltonian systems is based on the canonical symplectic structure of the phase space or on a Poisson structure that is obtained by (symmetry) reduction of the phase space, in the case of a port-Hamiltonian system the geometric structure derives from the interconnection of its sub-systems. This motivates to consider Dirac structures instead of Poisson structures, since this notion enables one to define Hamiltonian systems with algebraic constraints. As a result, any power-conserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems again defines a port-Hamiltonian system. The port-Hamiltonian description offers a systematic framework for analysis, control and simulation of complex physical systems, for lumped-parameter as well as for distributed-parameter models. \textcopyright{} 2006 European Mathematical Society.},

Key background topics, including linear matrix algebra and linear system theory, are covered, followed by different estimation and identification methods in the state-space model. With end-of-chapter exercises, MATLAB simulations and numerous illustrations, this book will appeal to graduate students and researchers in electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineering.

  author = {Vos, M. A.},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Monetary policy is the process by which the central bank attempts to maintain price stabil- ity. Typically, this is done by manipulating the interest rate. This process is executed by the central bank of a country or union. Specifically, the policy makers of a central bank make policy decisions manually, based on advise and experience. The process, of manipulating a variable to get the desired outcome, is a technology where system and control engineers are specialized in. Mostly, they focus on dynamical technological processes. Nevertheless, a new field in system and control theory pledges to widen this vari- ety. Specifically, towards applying these system and control theories to economic processes: Economic engineering. Up to now, very little attention is paid to the possibility of applying system and control theory to monetary policy. This work combines the current model of the European Central Bank (ECB), used to an- alyze monetary policy in the Eurozone, and the economic-engineering analog that can be used to model economics as if it were a mechanical system. It builds on these two theories by presenting monetary policy as a control problem. Firstly, the analog is extended in order to express money and interest in mechanical terms. With this extension, a first-principles model of the economy is developed. The results of the ECB's model are analyzed and an alternative is offered by the application of open loop transfer function characteristics. A PID controller is designed and the design conditions are interpreted as policy decisions. Finally, the effects of these design conditions are explained. The model, developed in this thesis, adds to existing models because of its distinction between disturbances and the control input. This contrasts the existing models because they approach both disturbances and control input similar - i.e. so called shocks. The first-principles mod- eling approach offers the first model that presents the underlying dynamics of the system. These dynamics can now be analyzed in the form of the effects of disturbances. The model offers the possibility to better understand monetary policy. Policymakers can now simulate possible policy actions and the effects on different economic variables, such as wages, GDP and investment. Master},

  abstract = {State-space models as an important mathematical tool has been widely used in many different fields. This edited collection explores recent theoretical developments of the models and their applications in economics and finance. The book includes nonlinear and non-Gaussian time series models, regime-switching and hidden Markov models, continuous- or discrete-time state processes, and models of equally-spaced or irregularly-spaced (discrete or continuous) observations. The contributed chapters are divided into four parts. The first part is on Particle Filtering and Parameter Learning in Nonlinear State-Space Models. The second part focuses on the application of Linear State-Space Models in Macroeconomics and Finance. The third part deals with Hidden Markov Models, Regime Switching and Mathematical Finance and the fourth part is on Nonlinear State-Space Models for High Frequency Financial Data. The book will appeal to graduate students and researchers studying state-space modeling in economics, statistics, and mathematics, as well as to finance professionals.},
