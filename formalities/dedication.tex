\begin{quote}
Vainly, the author, you picture yourself as your artworks’ creator,
over the Earth they have hovered forever remaining unnoticed.\\
Space harbors many invisible shapes and inaudible motives,
as it holds many delightful ensembles of colors and letters.

\begin{quote}
    It is incredible how much a well-chosen word can economize
    thought. Often one only needs to invent a new word, and this word becomes
    a creator on its own right.
\end{quote}
--- \emph{Henri Poincaré, loosely cited by Vladimir I. Arnol'd}
